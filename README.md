# AdvancedMachineLearning
This repository contains information about the course on Advanced Data Analysis and Machine Learning

### Time: Each Wednesday at 1215pm-2pm CET (The sessions will be recorded)

This is a course based on self-studies but with weekly meetings which will also function as lectures and discussions of learning material and projects.  The permanent zoom link is (also accessible from the weekly schedule)
