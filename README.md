# Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains information about the course on Advanced Data
Analysis and Machine Learning, spanning from weekly plans to lecture
material and various reading assignments.  The emphasis is on deep
learning algorithms, starting with the mathematics of neural networks
(NNs), moving on to convolutional NNs (CNNs) and recurrent NNs (RNNs),
autoencoders and other dimensionality reduction methods to finally
discuss generative methods. These will include Boltzmann machines,
variational autoencoders, generalized adversarial networks and more.
