    "1. a discriminator $D$ estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It works as a critic and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the realo ones. We say a  discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and those generated by the abovementioned generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. a generator $G$ outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input $z$ ($z$ brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution in order to generate samples that can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.\n",
