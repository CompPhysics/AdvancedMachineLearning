    "## Reminder from last week, what is a GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "A GAN is a deep neural network which consists of two networks, a\n",
    "so-called generator network and a discriminating network, or just\n",
    "discriminator. Through several iterations of generation and\n",
    "discrimination, the idea is that these networks will train each other,\n",
    "while also trying to outsmart each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest version, the two networks could be two standard neural networks with a given number of hidden of hidden layers and parameters to train.\n",
    "The generator we have trained can then be used to produce new images."

    "## Labeling the networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For a GAN we have: \n",
    "1. a discriminator $D$ estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It attempts at discriminating the trained data by the generator and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones (our data set). We say a  discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and those generated by the abovementioned generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. a generator $G$ outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input $z$ ($z$ brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution in order to generate samples that can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the training, the generator can be used to generate for\n",
    "example new images. In this sense we have trained a model which can\n",
    "produce new samples. We say that we have implicitely defined a\n",

    "## Which data?\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are generally a form of unsupervised machine learning, although\n",
    "they also incorporate aspects of supervised learning. Internally the\n",
    "discriminator sets up a supervised learning problem. Its goal is to\n",
    "learn to distinguish between the two classes of generated data and\n",
    "original data. The generator then considers this classification\n",
    "problem and tries to find adversarial examples, that is  samples which\n",
    "will be misclassified by the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also design GAN architectures which work in a\n",
    "semi-supervised learning setting. A semi-supervised learning environment includes both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, GANs can be used both on labeled and on unlabeled data and are used in three most commonly used contexts, that is\n",
    "1. with labeled data (supervised training)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. with unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)\n",
