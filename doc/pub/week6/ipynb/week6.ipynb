    "layers that are connected to themselves.\n",

    "2. Hessian Free Optimization: Deal with the vanishing gradients problem by using a fancy optimizer that can detect directions with a tiny gradient but even smaller curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Echo State Networks (ESN): Initialize the input a hidden and hidden-hidden and output-hidden connections very carefully so that the hidden state has a huge reservoir of weakly coupled oscillators which can be selectively driven by the input. ESNs only need to learn the hidden-output connections.\n",
