This term also appears in a vanilla VAE, and can be trained similarly.\n",

This term requires no optimization, as it has no trainable parameters; furthermore, as we have assumed a large enough $T$ such that the final distribution is Gaussian, this term effectively becomes zero."

That is, a denoising step from a noisier image should match the corresponding noising step from a cleaner image, for every intermediate timestep; this is reflected mathematically by the KL Divergence.  This term is minimized when we train $p_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t|\\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1})$ to match the Gaussian distribution $q(\\boldsymbol{x}_t|\\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1})$."
