    " * Study autoencoders and variational autoencoders with application to own data\n",

    " * Solve quantum/or classical many-body problems with deep learning methods (overlaps with FYS4411)\n",
    "\n",
    " * Physics informed Machine Learning, applications to for example solution of Navier-Stokes equations\n",
