    "Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning\n",
    "efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without\n",
    "any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings\n",
    "typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making\n",
    "autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders learn to encode the\n",
    "input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and then decode it\n",
    "back to the original data. The goal of autoencoders is to minimize the\n",
    "reconstruction error, which measures how well the output matches the\n",
    "input. Autoencoders can be seen as a way of learning the latent\n",
    "features or hidden structure of the data, and they can be used for\n",

    "\n",
    "More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks\n",
    "very similar to the training data; this is called a generative\n",
    "model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of\n",
    "faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,\n",
    "autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their\n",
    "outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that\n",
    "constraining the network in various ways can make it rather\n",
    "difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal\n",
    "representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the\n",
    "network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the\n",
    "autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,\n",
    "which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In\n",
