<p>Neural networks, in its so-called feed-forward form, where each
iterations contains a feed-forward stage and a back-propgagation
stage, consist of series of affine matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications. The unknown parameters (the so-called biases and

uptaded iteratively using the so-called back-propagation algorithm.
This algorithm corresponds to the so-called reverse mode of

<p>A neural network consists of a series of hidden layers, in addition to

parameters in other layers through a series of affine transformations,
for a standard NN these are matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications.  For all layers we will simply use a collective variable \( \boldsymbol{\Theta} \).

<p>It consist of two basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> a feed forward stage which takes a given input and produces a final output which is compared with the target values through our cost/loss function.</li>
<li> a back-propagation state where the unknown parameters \( \boldsymbol{\Theta} \) are updated through the optimization of the their gradients. The expressions for the gradients are obtained via the chain rule, starting from the derivative of the cost/function.</li>

<h2 id="hidden-layers" class="anchor">Hidden layers </h2>

<p>For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and
it will work just fine.  For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a
high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons.
You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden
layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the same
amount of training time.
</p>

<p>For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp up the number of
hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very
complex tasks, such as large image classification or speech
recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers and they
need a huge amount of training data. However, you will rarely have to
train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse
parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar
task.

<h2 id="which-activation-function-should-i-use" class="anchor">Which activation function should I use? </h2>

<p>The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from
the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on
the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost
function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these
gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as
the algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result,
the GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights virtually
unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is
known in the literature as <b>the vanishing gradients problem</b>.
</p>

<p>In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can
grow bigger and bigger. The result is that many of the layers get
large updates of the weights the algorithm diverges. This is the
<b>exploding gradients problem</b>, which is mostly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep neural networks suffer
from unstable gradients, different layers may learn at widely
different speeds

<h2 id="is-the-logistic-activation-function-sigmoid-our-choice" class="anchor">Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice? </h2>

<p>Although this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for
quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were
mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that
significant progress was made in understanding it.
</p>

<p>A paper titled <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html" target="_self">Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep
Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio</a> found that
the problems with the popular logistic
sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique
that was most popular at the time, namely random initialization using
a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. 
</p>

<p>They showed that with this activation function and this
initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is
much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the
network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the
activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made
worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0
(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly
better than the logistic function in deep networks).
</p>

<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="the-derivative-of-the-logistic-funtion" class="anchor">The derivative of the Logistic funtion </h2>

<p>Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large
(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a
derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,
it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,
and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as
backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is
really nothing left for the lower layers.
</p>

<p>In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly
alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both
directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in
the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don&#8217;t want
the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For
the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the
variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of
its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance
before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.

<h2 id="insights-from-the-paper-by-glorot-and-bengio" class="anchor">Insights from the paper by Glorot and Bengio </h2>

<p>One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that
the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor
choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that
if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in
biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out
that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural
networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because
it does not saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite
fast to compute).
</p>

<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="the-relu-function-family" class="anchor">The RELU function family </h2>

<p>The ReLU activation function suffers from a problem known as the dying
ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning they
stop outputting anything other than 0.
</p>

<p>In some cases, you may find that half of your network&#8217;s neurons are
dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During training,
if a neuron&#8217;s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the
neuron&#8217;s inputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this
happen, the neuron is unlikely to come back to life since the gradient
of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.
</p>

<p>To solve this problem, nowadays practitioners use a variant of the
ReLU function, such as the leaky ReLU discussed above or the so-called
exponential linear unit (ELU) function
</p>

$$
ELU(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \alpha\left( \exp{(z)}-1\right) & z < 0,\\  z & z \ge 0.\end{array}\right. 
$$


<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="which-activation-function-should-we-use" class="anchor">Which activation function should we use? </h2>

<p>In general it seems that the ELU activation function is better than
the leaky ReLU function (and its variants), which is better than
ReLU. ReLU performs better than \( \tanh \) which in turn performs better
than the logistic function.
</p>

<p>If runtime performance is an issue, then you may opt for the leaky
ReLU function over the ELU function If you don&#8217;t want to tweak yet
another hyperparameter, you may just use the default \( \alpha \) of
\( 0.01 \) for the leaky ReLU, and \( 1 \) for ELU. If you have spare time and
computing power, you can use cross-validation or bootstrap to evaluate
other activation functions.

<h2 id="more-on-activation-functions-output-layers" class="anchor">More on activation functions, output layers </h2>

<p>In most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden
layers (or one of its variants).
</p>

<p>It is a bit faster to compute than other activation functions, and the
gradient descent optimization does in general not get stuck.
</p>

<b>For the output layer:</b>

<ul>
<li> For classification the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive).</li>
<li> For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all.</li>

<h2 id="batch-normalization" class="anchor">Batch Normalization </h2>

<p>Batch Normalization aims to address the vanishing/exploding gradients
problems, and more generally the problem that the distribution of each
layer&#8217;s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the
previous layers change.
</p>

<p>The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before
the activation function of each layer, simply zero-centering and
normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two
new parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In
other words, this operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and
mean of the inputs for each layer.  In order to zero-center and
normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs&#8217; mean
and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard
deviation of the inputs over the current mini-batch, from this the
name batch normalization.

<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="dropout" class="anchor">Dropout </h2>

<p>It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron
(including the input neurons but excluding the output neurons) has a
probability \( p \) of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be
entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active
during the next step.
</p>

<p>The hyperparameter \( p \) is called the dropout rate, and it is typically
set to 50%. After training, the neurons are not dropped anymore.  It
is viewed as one of the most popular regularization techniques.
</p>

<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="gradient-clipping" class="anchor">Gradient Clipping </h2>

<p>A popular technique to lessen the exploding gradients problem is to
simply clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never
exceed some threshold (this is mostly useful for recurrent neural
networks).
</p>

<p>This technique is called Gradient Clipping.</p>

<p>In general however, Batch
Normalization is preferred.

<h2 id="a-top-down-perspective-on-neural-networks" class="anchor">A top-down perspective on Neural networks </h2>

<p>The first thing we would like to do is divide the data into two or
three parts. A training set, a validation or dev (development) set,
and a test set. The test set is the data on which we want to make
predictions. The dev set is a subset of the training data we use to
check how well we are doing out-of-sample, after training the model on
the training dataset. We use the validation error as a proxy for the
test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we
do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a
cardinal sin in ML. Then:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Estimate optimal error rate</li>
<li> Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.</li>
<li> Make sure you are not overfitting.</li>
</ul>
<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="more-top-down-perspectives" class="anchor">More top-down perspectives </h2>

<p>If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions,
then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly
good performance on the test set. 
</p>

<p>However, sometimes
the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for
example, they are collected using slightly different methods, or
because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In
this case, there can be a mismatch between the training and test
data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small
differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance
on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation
set. To rectify this, Andrew Ng suggests making two validation or dev
sets, one constructed from the training data and one constructed from
the test data. The difference between the performance of the algorithm
on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This
can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for
supervised learning.

<h2 id="limitations-of-supervised-learning-with-deep-networks" class="anchor">Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks </h2>

<p>Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural
networks has important limitations. This is especially important when
one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like
all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or
better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few
hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random
features). 
</p>

<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="limitations-of-nns" class="anchor">Limitations of NNs </h2>

<p>Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Need labeled data</b>. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).</li>
<li> <b>Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.</b> DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.</li>
</ul>
<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="homogeneous-data" class="anchor">Homogeneous data </h2>

<ul>
<li> <b>Homogeneous data.</b> Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e.&nbsp;some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.</li>
</ul>
<!-- !split -->
<h2 id="more-limitations" class="anchor">More limitations </h2>

<ul>
<li> <b>Many problems are not about prediction.</b> In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a <em>wrong</em> model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.</p>
