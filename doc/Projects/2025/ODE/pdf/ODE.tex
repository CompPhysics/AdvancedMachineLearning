\subsection*{Solving  differential equations with neural networks}

Here we describe the possible differential equations we can study
first with neural networks and thereafter with recurrent neural
networks and/or Autoenconders.  Feel free to use own codes or TensorFlow/Keras.PyTorch or toher libraries.
Furthermore, you can change the type of differential equations.

The differential equations are given by the so-called \href{{https://encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Lorenz_attractor}}{Lorenz attractor model}, and read

\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=\sigma\left(y-x\right),
\]
where $\sigma =10$ is a constant
\[
\frac{dy}{dt}= x\left(\rho-z\right)-y,
\]
with $\rho=28$ and
\[
\frac{dz}{dt}=xy-\beta z
\]

with $\beta=8/3$ as our final constant.

The following function is a
simple function which sets up the solution using the ordinary
differential library which follows \textbf{NumPy}. Here we have fixed the
time sted $\Delta t=0.01$ and the final time $t_f=8$.

The program sets $100$ random initial values and produces inputs and outputs for a neural network calculations.
The inputs are given by the values of the array $\bm{x}$ (which contains $x,y,z$ as functions of time) for the time step $\bm{x}_t$.
The other array defined by $\bm{x}_{t+1}$ contains the outputs (or targets) which we want the neural network to reproduce.

nninput = np.zeros((100*len(t)-1,3))

# Define the equations to integrate
def lorenz_derivative(xyz, t0, sigma=sigma,beta=beta,rho=rho):
    x, y, z = xyz
    return [sigma*(x-y), x*(rho-z)-y, x*y-beta*z]

# generate 100 random initial values
x0 = -15.0+30.0*np.random.random((100,3))

# Use odeint functionality by sending in derivative function
# Feel free to change the choice of integrator
x_t = np.asarray([odeint(lorenz_derivative, x0_j, t) 
                  for x0_j in x0])

# define the inputs and outputs for the neural networks
for j in range(100):
    nninput[j*(len(t)-1):(j+1)*(len(t)-1),:] = x_t[j,:-1,:]
    nnoutput[j*(len(t)-1):(j+1)*(len(t)-1),:] = x_t[j,1:,:]


\end{verbatim}


The input and output variables are those we will start trying our
network with. Your first taks is to set up a neural code (either using
your own code or TensorFlow/PyTorch or similar libraries)) and use the
above data to a prediction for the time evolution of Lorenz system for
various values of the randomly chosen initial values.  Study the
dependence of the fit as function of the architecture of the network
(number of nodes, hidden layers and types of activation functions) and
various regularization schemes and optimization methods like standard
gradient descent with momentum, stochastic gradient descent with
batches and with and without momentum and various schedulers for the
learning rate.

Feel free to change the above differential equations. As an example,
consider the following harmonic oscillator equations solved with the
Runge-Kutta to fourth order method. This is a one-dimensional problem
and it produces a position $x_t$ and velocity $v_t$. You could now try
to fit both the velocities and positions using much of the same recipe
as for Lorenz attractor.  You will find it convenient to analyze one
set of initial conditions first. The code is included here.

This code is an example code that solves Newton's equations of motion
with a given force and produces an output which in turn can be used to
train a neural network

The next step is to include recurrent neural networks. 

\subsection*{Introduction to numerical projects}

Here follows a brief recipe and recommendation on how to write a report for each
project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.

  \item Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.

  \item Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.

  \item If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.

  \item Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.

  \item Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.

  \item Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.

  \item Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.

  \item Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection*{Format for electronic delivery of report and programs}

The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Send us an email in order  to hand in your projects with a link to your GitHub/Gitlab repository.

  \item In your GitHub/GitLab or similar repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Finally, 
we encourage you to collaborate. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report.
