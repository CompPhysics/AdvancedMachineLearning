For the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using neural networks, the lectures by of week 43 at for example <https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/week42/html/week43.html> at this course are highly recommended.\n",

We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",

You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning."
