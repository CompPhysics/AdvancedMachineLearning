    "## Paths for the projects\n",
    "\n",
    "* The computational path: Here we propose a path where you develop your own code for a convolutional or eventually recurrent neural network and apply this to data selects of your own selection. The code should be object oriented and flexible allowing for eventual extensions by including different Loss/Cost functions and other functionalities. Feel free toselect data sets from those suggested below here. This code can also be extended upon by adding for example autoencoders. You can compare your own codes with implementations using TensorFlow(Keras)/PyTorch or other libraries. An alternative is to develop a code for an RNN inclusing long-term-short-memory (LSTM). This is often the starting point for large-language models and so-called transformers. Large language models are hovever not discussed during the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The differential equation path: Here we propose a set of differential equations (ordinary and/or partial) to be solved first using neural networks (using either your own code or TensorFlow/Pytorch or similar libraries). Thereafter we plan to extend the set of methods for solving these equations to recurrent neural networks and autoencoders (AE). This project can also be extended into including Physics informed machine learning, see <https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs>. Here we can discuss neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given law of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The application path: Here you can use the most relevant method(s) (say convolutional neural networks for images) and apply this(these) to data sets relevant for your own research.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Gaussian processes/Bayesian statistics path: Kernel regression (Gaussian processes) and Bayesian statistics, see <https://jenfb.github.io/bkmr/overview.html>, are  popular tools in the machine learning literature. The main idea behind these approaches is to flexibly model the relationship between a large number of variables and a particular outcome (dependent variable). This can form a second part of a project where for example standard Kernel regression methods are used on a specific data set. Alternatively, participants can opt to work on a large project relevant for their own research using gaussian processes and/or Bayesian machine Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Other possibilities."
