Dear all,
I hope you are doing well and that you are ready for the final oral exam. This counts 30% of the grade. The report counts 70% and you should prepare a presentation which lasts approx 25-30 mins and is based on your report, that is you present your report with theory, models, results etc.  After your presentation we (the external examiner and myself) will ask questions about your report and presentation. The questions will only be about your work, we will not ask about things which are not in the report. 
The external examiner is Dr. Giovanni Pederiva (he did his master thesis at UiO and knows very well our grading system and more), now researcher at Forschungzentrum Juelich in Germany.
Here is a suggested schedule (note the times are not easy to change but you can change among yourself).

Monday June 19:
10-11 Keran Chen
11-12 Greg Kajda
12-13 Marcus Berget
13-14 Vilde Ung

Tuesday. June 20
9-10 Knut Magnus Aasrud
11-12 Daniel Haas
12-13 Simen LÃ¸ken
17-18 Adam Jakobsen
18-19 Nigar Abbasova

Best wishes,
Morten
