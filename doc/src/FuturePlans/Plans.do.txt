===== To do list =====

o Improve notes about VAEs and Boltzmann machines, add codes
o Improve notes about Diffusion models and add codes
o Stable diffusion, add examples and eventually codes
o Notes about Pytorch, use for advanced methods, short introduction to simpler methods like normal regression cases and more
o Reshape projects and add weekly exercises
o Develop library of codes from scratch, starting with simple examples and then adding advanced.
o Make textbook as jupyter-book and latex textbook
o Make own figures of AE, VAE, RNNs, CNNs and other methods
o Try to merge this material with the FYS-STK material and make both pdf and jupyter-notebook
o Normalizing flow models, include these with an eye on diffusion models
o Autoregressive models?  Perhaps keep with RNNs plus LSTMs?
o Reinforcement?  Transfer?  or use Bayesian calculus?
