!split
===== From last week: Overarching view of a neural network =====

The architecture of a neural network defines our model. This model
aims at describing some function $f(\bm{x}$ that is meant to describe
some final result (outputs or target values $bm{y}$) given a specific input
$\bm{x}$. Note that here $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{x}$ are not limited to be
vectors.

The architecture consists of
o An input and an output layer where the input layer is defined by the inputs $\bm{x}$. The output layer produces the model ouput $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ which is compared with the target value $\bm{y}$
o A given number of hidden layers and neurons/nodes/units for each layer (this may vary)
o A given activation function $\sigma(\bm{z})$ with arguments $\bm{z}$ to be defined below. The activation functions may differ from layer to layer.
o The last layer, normally called _output_ layer has an activation function tailored to the specific problem
o Finally, we define a so-called cost or loss function which is used to gauge the quality of our model. 


!split
===== The optimization problem =====

The cost function is a function of the unknown parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ where the latter is a container for all possible
parameters needed to define a neural network

If we are dealing with a regression task a typical cost/loss function
is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define
the so-called cost function. Note that here we have assumed a linear dependence in terms of the paramters $\bm{\Theta}$. This is in general not the case.


!split
===== Parameters of neural networks =====
For neural networks the parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ are given by the so-called weights and biases (to be
defined below).

The weights are given by matrix elements $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ where the
superscript indicates the layer number. The biases are typically given
by vector elements representing each single node of a given layer,
that is $b_j^{(l)}$.

!split
===== Other ingredients of a neural network =====

Having defined the architecture of a neural network, the optimization
of the cost function with respect to the parameters $\bm{\Theta}$,
involves the calculations of gradients and their optimization. The
gradients represent the derivatives of a multidimensional object and
are often approximated by various gradient methods, including
o various quasi-Newton methods,
o plain gradient descent (GD) with a constant learning rate $\eta$,
o GD with momentum and other approximations to the learning rates such as
  * Adapative gradient (ADAgrad)
  * Root mean-square propagation (RMSprop)
  * Adaptive gradient with momentum (ADAM) and many other
o Stochastic gradient descent and various families of learning rate approximations

!split
===== Other parameters =====

In addition to the above, there are often additional hyperparamaters
which are included in the setup of a neural network. These will be
discussed below.





!split
===== From last week, overarching discussions of neural networks: Fine-tuning neural network hyperparameters =====

The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main
drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you
use any imaginable network topology (how neurons/nodes are
interconnected), but even in a simple FFNN you can change the number
of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the type of activation
function to use in each layer, the weight initialization logic, the
stochastic gradient optmized and much more. How do you know what
combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?

* You can use grid search with cross-validation to find the right hyperparameters.

However,since there are many hyperparameters to tune, and since
training a neural network on a large dataset takes a lot of time, you
will only be able to explore a tiny part of the hyperparameter space.


* You can use randomized search.
* Or use tools like "Oscar":"http://oscar.calldesk.ai/", which implements more complex algorithms to help you find a good set of hyperparameters quickly.  

!split
===== Hidden layers =====



For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and
it will work just fine.  For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a
high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons.
You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden
layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the same
amount of training time.

For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp up the number of
hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very
complex tasks, such as large image classification or speech
recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers and they
need a huge amount of training data. However, you will rarely have to
train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse
parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar
task.




!split 
===== Which activation function should I use? =====

The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from
the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on
the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost
function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these
gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.


Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as
the algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result,
the GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights virtually
unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is
known in the literature as _the vanishing gradients problem_.

In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can
grow bigger and bigger. The result is that many of the layers get
large updates of the weights the algorithm diverges. This is the
_exploding gradients problem_, which is mostly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep neural networks suffer
from unstable gradients, different layers may learn at widely
different speeds



!split 
===== Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice? =====

Although this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for
quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were
mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that
significant progress was made in understanding it.

A paper titled "Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep
Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html" found that
the problems with the popular logistic
sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique
that was most popular at the time, namely random initialization using
a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. 

They showed that with this activation function and this
initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is
much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the
network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the
activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made
worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0
(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly
better than the logistic function in deep networks).


!split
===== The derivative of the Logistic funtion =====

Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large
(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a
derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,
it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,
and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as
backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is
really nothing left for the lower layers.

In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly
alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both
directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in
the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want
the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For
the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the
variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of
its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance
before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.


!split
===== Insights from the paper by Glorot and Bengio =====

One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that
the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor
choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that
if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in
biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out
that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural
networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because
it does not saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite
fast to compute).



!split
===== The RELU function family =====

The ReLU activation function suffers from a problem known as the dying
ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning they
stop outputting anything other than 0.

In some cases, you may find that half of your network’s neurons are
dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During training,
if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the
neuron’s inputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this
happen, the neuron is unlikely to come back to life since the gradient
of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.

To solve this problem, nowadays practitioners use a variant of the
ReLU function, such as the leaky ReLU discussed above or the so-called
exponential linear unit (ELU) function


!bt
\[
ELU(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \alpha\left( \exp{(z)}-1\right) & z < 0,\\  z & z \ge 0.\end{array}\right. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Which activation function should we use? =====

In general it seems that the ELU activation function is better than
the leaky ReLU function (and its variants), which is better than
ReLU. ReLU performs better than $\tanh$ which in turn performs better
than the logistic function.

If runtime performance is an issue, then you may opt for the leaky
ReLU function over the ELU function If you don’t want to tweak yet
another hyperparameter, you may just use the default $\alpha$ of
$0.01$ for the leaky ReLU, and $1$ for ELU. If you have spare time and
computing power, you can use cross-validation or bootstrap to evaluate
other activation functions.


!split
=====  More on activation functions, output layers =====

In most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden
layers (or one of its variants).

It is a bit faster to compute than other activation functions, and the
gradient descent optimization does in general not get stuck.

_For the output layer:_

* For classification the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive).
* For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all.




!split
===== Batch Normalization =====

Batch Normalization aims to address the vanishing/exploding gradients
problems, and more generally the problem that the distribution of each
layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the
previous layers change.

The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before
the activation function of each layer, simply zero-centering and
normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two
new parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In
other words, this operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and
mean of the inputs for each layer.  In order to zero-center and
normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs’ mean
and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard
deviation of the inputs over the current mini-batch, from this the
name batch normalization.

!split
===== Dropout =====

It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron
(including the input neurons but excluding the output neurons) has a
probability $p$ of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be
entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active
during the next step.

The hyperparameter $p$ is called the dropout rate, and it is typically
set to 50%. After training, the neurons are not dropped anymore.  It
is viewed as one of the most popular regularization techniques.

!split
===== Gradient Clipping =====

A popular technique to lessen the exploding gradients problem is to
simply clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never
exceed some threshold (this is mostly useful for recurrent neural
networks).

This technique is called Gradient Clipping.

In general however, Batch
Normalization is preferred.

!split
=====  A very nice website on Neural Networks =====

!split 
===== A top-down perspective on Neural networks =====


The first thing we would like to do is divide the data into two or
three parts. A training set, a validation or dev (development) set,
and a test set. The test set is the data on which we want to make
predictions. The dev set is a subset of the training data we use to
check how well we are doing out-of-sample, after training the model on
the training dataset. We use the validation error as a proxy for the
test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we
do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a
cardinal sin in ML. Then:

 
* Estimate optimal error rate

* Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.

* Make sure you are not overfitting.



!split
===== More top-down perspectives =====

If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions,
then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly
good performance on the test set. 

However, sometimes
the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for
example, they are collected using slightly different methods, or
because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In
this case, there can be a mismatch between the training and test
data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small
differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance
on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation
set. To rectify this, Andrew Ng suggests making two validation or dev
sets, one constructed from the training data and one constructed from
the test data. The difference between the performance of the algorithm
on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This
can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for
supervised learning.

!split
===== Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks =====

Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural
networks has important limitations. This is especially important when
one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like
all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or
better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few
hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random
features). 


!split
===== Limitations of NNs =====

Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. 



* _Need labeled data_. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).
* _Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive._ DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.


!split
===== Homogeneous data =====

* _Homogeneous data._ Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e.~some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.

!split
===== More limitations =====


* _Many problems are not about prediction._ In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.

Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.

!split
===== Codes =====

We present here three different possibilities. The first one is based
on own codes, the second alternative uses TensorFlow with Keras, while
the last version is a simple PyTorch implementation.





!split
===== Building a neural network code =====

Here we  present a flexible object oriented codebase
for a feed forward neural network, along with a demonstration of how
to use it. Before we get into the details of the neural network, we
will first present some implementations of various schedulers, cost
functions and activation functions that can be used together with the
neural network.

The codes here were developed by Eric Reber and Gregor Kajda during spring 2023.

=== Learning rate methods  ===

The code below shows object oriented implementations of the Constant,
Momentum, Adagrad, AdagradMomentum, RMS prop and Adam schedulers. All
of the classes belong to the shared abstract Scheduler class, and
share the update-change() and reset() methods allowing for any of the
schedulers to be seamlessly used during the training stage, as will
later be shown in the fit() method of the neural
network. Update-change() only has one parameter, the gradient
($δ^l_ja^{l−1}_k$), and returns the change which will be subtracted
from the weights. The reset() function takes no parameters, and resets
the desired variables. For Constant and Momentum, reset does nothing.

!ec

=== Usage of the above learning rate schedulers ===

To initalize a scheduler, simply create the object and pass in the
necessary parameters such as the learning rate and the momentum as
shown below. As the Scheduler class is an abstract class it should not
called directly, and will raise an error upon usage.

!bc pycod
momentum_scheduler = Momentum(eta=1e-3, momentum=0.9)
adam_scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
!ec

Here is a small example for how a segment of code using schedulers
could look. Switching out the schedulers is simple.

!bc pycod
weights = np.ones((3,3))
print(f"Before scheduler:\n{weights=}")

epochs = 10
for e in range(epochs):
    gradient = np.random.rand(3, 3)
    change = adam_scheduler.update_change(gradient)
    weights = weights - change
    adam_scheduler.reset()

print(f"\nAfter scheduler:\n{weights=}")
!ec


=== Cost functions ===

Here we discuss cost functions that can be used when creating the
neural network. Every cost function takes the target vector as its
parameter, and returns a function valued only at $x$ such that it may
easily be differentiated.


!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np

def CostOLS(target):
    
    def func(X):
        return (1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum((target - X) ** 2)

    return func


def CostLogReg(target):

    def func(X):
        
        return -(1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum(
            (target * np.log(X + 10e-10)) + ((1 - target) * np.log(1 - X + 10e-10))
        )

    return func


def CostCrossEntropy(target):
    
    def func(X):
        return -(1.0 / target.size) * np.sum(target * np.log(X + 10e-10))

    return func
!ec


Below we give a short example of how these cost function may be used
to obtain results if you wish to test them out on your own using
AutoGrad's automatics differentiation.

!bc pycod
from autograd import grad

target = np.array([[1, 2, 3]]).T
a = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T

cost_func = CostCrossEntropy
cost_func_derivative = grad(cost_func(target))

valued_at_a = cost_func_derivative(a)
print(f"Derivative of cost function {cost_func.__name__} valued at a:\n{valued_at_a}")
!ec


=== Activation functions ===

Finally, before we look at the neural network, we will look at the
activation functions which can be specified between the hidden layers
and as the output function. Each function can be valued for any given
vector or matrix X, and can be differentiated via derivate().

!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import elementwise_grad

def identity(X):
    return X


def sigmoid(X):
    try:
        return 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
    except FloatingPointError:
        return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), np.ones(X.shape), np.zeros(X.shape))


def softmax(X):
    X = X - np.max(X, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    delta = 10e-10
    return np.exp(X) / (np.sum(np.exp(X), axis=-1, keepdims=True) + delta)


def RELU(X):
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, np.zeros(X.shape))


def LRELU(X):
    delta = 10e-4
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, delta * X)


def derivate(func):

Below follows a short demonstration of how to use an activation
function. The derivative of the activation function will be important
when calculating the output delta term during backpropagation. Note
that derivate() can also be used for cost functions for a more
generalized approach.

!bc pycod
z = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T
print(f"Input to activation function:\n{z}")

act_func = sigmoid
a = act_func(z)
print(f"\nOutput from {act_func.__name__} activation function:\n{a}")

act_func_derivative = derivate(act_func)
valued_at_z = act_func_derivative(a)
print(f"\nDerivative of {act_func.__name__} activation function valued at z:\n{valued_at_z}")

=== The Neural Network ===

Now that we have gotten a good understanding of the implementation of
some important components, we can take a look at an object oriented
implementation of a feed forward neural network. The feed forward
neural network has been implemented as a class named FFNN, which can
be initiated as a regressor or classifier dependant on the choice of
cost function. The FFNN can have any number of input nodes, hidden
layers with any amount of hidden nodes, and any amount of output nodes
meaning it can perform multiclass classification as well as binary
classification and regression problems. Although there is a lot of
code present, it makes for an easy to use and generalizeable interface
for creating many types of neural networks as will be demonstrated
below.

Before we make a model, we will quickly generate a dataset we can use
for our linear regression problem as shown below

!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def SkrankeFunction(x, y):
    return np.ravel(0 + 1*x + 2*y + 3*x**2 + 4*x*y + 5*y**2)

def create_X(x, y, n):
    if len(x.shape) > 1:
        x = np.ravel(x)
        y = np.ravel(y)

    N = len(x)
    l = int((n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2)  # Number of elements in beta
    X = np.ones((N, l))

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        q = int((i) * (i + 1) / 2)
        for k in range(i + 1):
            X[:, q + k] = (x ** (i - k)) * (y**k)

    return X

step=0.5
x = np.arange(0, 1, step)
y = np.arange(0, 1, step)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
target = SkrankeFunction(x, y)
target = target.reshape(target.shape[0], 1)

poly_degree=3
X = create_X(x, y, poly_degree)

X_train, X_test, t_train, t_test = train_test_split(X, target)

!ec

Now that we have our dataset ready for the regression, we can create
our regressor. Note that with the seed parameter, we can make sure our
results stay the same every time we run the neural network. For
inititialization, we simply specify the dimensions (we wish the amount
of input nodes to be equal to the datapoints, and the output to
predict one value).


!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

linear_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=identity, cost_func=CostOLS, seed=2023)

!ec

We then fit our model with our training data using the scheduler of our choice.

!bc pycod
linear_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Constant(eta=1e-3)
scores = linear_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler)


!ec

Due to the progress bar we can see the MSE (train_error) throughout
the FFNN's training. Note that the fit() function has some optional
parameters with defualt arguments. For example, the regularization
hyperparameter can be left ignored if not needed, and equally the FFNN
will by default run for 100 epochs. These can easily be changed, such
as for example:

!bc pycod
linear_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scores = linear_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, lam=1e-4, epochs=1000)

!ec

We see that given more epochs to train on, the regressor reaches a lower MSE.

Let us then switch to a binary classification. We use a binary
classification dataset, and follow a similar setup to the regression
case.



!bc pycod
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

wisconsin = load_breast_cancer()
X = wisconsin.data
target = wisconsin.target
target = target.reshape(target.shape[0], 1)

X_train, X_val, t_train, t_val = train_test_split(X, target)

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)


!ec

!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

logistic_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)

!ec

We will now make use of our validation data by passing it into our fit function as a keyword argument

!bc pycod
logistic_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = logistic_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, epochs=1000, X_val=X_val, t_val=t_val)


!ec

Finally, we will create a neural network with 2 hidden layers with activation functions.
!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
hidden_nodes1 = 100
hidden_nodes2 = 30
output_nodes = 1

dims = (input_nodes, hidden_nodes1, hidden_nodes2, output_nodes)

neural_network = FFNN(dims, hidden_func=RELU, output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)


!ec

!bc pycod
neural_network.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-4, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = neural_network.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, epochs=1000, X_val=X_val, t_val=t_val)

!ec

=== Multiclass classification ===

Finally, we will demonstrate the use case of multiclass classification
using our FFNN with the famous MNIST dataset, which contain images of
digits between the range of 0 to 9.


!bc pycod
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

def onehot(target: np.ndarray):
    onehot = np.zeros((target.size, target.max() + 1))
    onehot[np.arange(target.size), target] = 1
    return onehot

digits = load_digits()

X = digits.data
target = digits.target
target = onehot(target)

input_nodes = 64
hidden_nodes1 = 100
hidden_nodes2 = 30
output_nodes = 10

dims = (input_nodes, hidden_nodes1, hidden_nodes2, output_nodes)

multiclass = FFNN(dims, hidden_func=LRELU, output_func=softmax, cost_func=CostCrossEntropy)

multiclass.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-4, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = multiclass.fit(X, target, scheduler, epochs=1000)

!ec

===== Testing the XOR gate and other gates =====

Let us now use our code to test the XOR gate.

!bc pycod
X = np.array([ [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0],[1, 1]],dtype=np.float64)

# The XOR gate
yXOR = np.array( [[ 0], [1] ,[1], [0]])

input_nodes = X.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

logistic_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)
logistic_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights
scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-1, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = logistic_regression.fit(X, yXOR, scheduler, epochs=1000)
!ec
Not bad, but the results depend strongly on the learning reate. Try different learning rates.

!split
===== Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images) =====


Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.

CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).

!split
===== What is the Difference =====

_CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network._



!split
===== Neural Networks vs CNNs =====

Neural networks are defined as _affine transformations_, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.


!split
===== Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? =====

However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:
* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .
* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).
* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).

These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.

A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).




!split
===== Regular NNs don’t scale well to full images =====

As an example, consider
an image of size $32\times 32\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have $32\times 32\times 3 = 3072$ weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say $200\times 200\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have 
$200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. 

We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.

FIGURE: [figslides/nn.jpeg, width=500 frac=0.6]  A regular 3-layer Neural Network.

!split
===== 3D volumes of neurons ===== 

Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way. 

In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)

To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions $32\times 32\times 3$ (width, height,
depth respectively). 

The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions $1\times 1 \times 10$, 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension. 

FIGURE: [figslides/cnn.jpeg, width=500 frac=0.6]  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels).


!split
===== More on Dimensionalities =====

In fields like signal processing (and imaging as well), one designs
so-called filters. These filters are defined by the convolutions and
are often hand-crafted. One may specify filters for smoothing, edge
detection, frequency reshaping, and similar operations. However with
neural networks the idea is to automatically learn the filters and use
many of them in conjunction with non-linear operations (activation
functions).

As an example consider a neural network operating on sound sequence
data.  Assume that we an input vector $\bm{x}$ of length $d=10^6$.  We
construct then a neural network with onle hidden layer only with
$10^4$ nodes. This means that we will have a weight matrix with
$10^4\times 10^6=10^{10}$ weights to be determined, together with $10^4$ biases.

Assume furthermore that we have an output layer which is meant to train whether the sound sequence represents a human voice (true) or something else (false).
It means that we have only one output node. But since this output node connects to $10^4$ nodes in the hidden layer, there are in total $10^4$ weights to be determined for the output layer, plus one bias. In total we have

!bt
\[
\mathrm{NumberParameters}=10^{10}+10^4+10^4+1 \approx 10^{10},
\]
!et
that is ten billion parameters to determine. 


!split
===== Further remarks =====



The main principles that justify convolutions is locality of
information and repetion of patterns within the signal. Sound samples
of the input in adjacent spots are much more likely to affect each
other than those that are very far away. Similarly, sounds are
repeated in multiple times in the signal. While slightly simplistic,
reasoning about such a sound example demonstrates this. The same
principles then apply to images and other similar data.





!split 
===== Layers used to build CNNs =====


A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.

A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:

* _INPUT_ ($32\times 32 \times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.
* _CONV_ (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\times 32\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.
* _RELU_ layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\times 32\times 12]$).
* _POOL_ (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\times 16\times 12]$.
* _FC_ (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\times 1\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.


!split
===== Transforming images =====

CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original
pixel values to the final class scores. 

Observe that some layers contain
parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform
transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the
input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of
the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a
fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained
with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes
are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.


!split
===== CNNs in brief =====

In summary:

* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)
* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)
* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function
* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)
* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

===== Key Idea =====

A dense neural network is representd by an affine operation (like matrix-matrix multiplication) where all parameters are included.

The key idea in CNNs for say imaging is that in images neighbor pixels tend to be related! So we connect
only neighboring neurons in the input instead of connecting all with the first hidden layer.

We say we perform a filtering (convolution is the mathematical operation). 






!split
===== Mathematics of CNNs =====

The mathematics of CNNs is based on the mathematical operation of
_convolution_.  In mathematics (in particular in functional analysis),
convolution is represented by mathematical operations (integration,
summation etc) on two functions in order to produce a third function
that expresses how the shape of one gets modified by the other.
Convolution has a plethora of applications in a variety of
disciplines, spanning from statistics to signal processing, computer
vision, solutions of differential equations,linear algebra,
engineering, and yes, machine learning.

Mathematically, convolution is defined as follows (one-dimensional example):
Let us define a continuous function $y(t)$ given by
!bt
\[
y(t) = \int x(a) w(t-a) da,
\]
!et
where $x(a)$ represents a so-called input and $w(t-a)$ is normally called the weight function or kernel.

The above integral is written in  a more compact form as
!bt
\[
y(t) = \left(x * w\right)(t).
\]
!et

The discretized version reads
!bt
\[
y(t) = \sum_{a=-\infty}^{a=\infty}x(a)w(t-a).
\]
!et
Computing the inverse of the above convolution operations is known as deconvolution and the process is commutative.

How can we use this? And what does it mean? Let us study some familiar examples first.


!split
===== Convolution Examples: Polynomial multiplication =====

Our first example is that of a multiplication between two polynomials,
which we will rewrite in terms of the mathematics of convolution. In
the final stage, since the problem here is a discrete one, we will
recast the final expression in terms of a matrix-vector
multiplication, where the matrix is a so-called "Toeplitz matrix
":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-93-86279-04-0".

Let us look a the following polynomials to second and third order, respectively:
!bt
\[
p(t) = \alpha_0+\alpha_1 t+\alpha_2 t^2,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
s(t) = \beta_0+\beta_1 t+\beta_2 t^2+\beta_3 t^3.
\]
!et

The polynomial multiplication gives us a new polynomial of degree $5$
!bt
\[
z(t) = \delta_0+\delta_1 t+\delta_2 t^2+\delta_3 t^3+\delta_4 t^4+\delta_5 t^5.
\]
!et

!split
===== Efficient Polynomial Multiplication =====

Computing polynomial products can be implemented efficiently if we rewrite the more brute force multiplications using convolution.
We note first that the new coefficients are given as

!bt
\begin{split}
\delta_0=&\alpha_0\beta_0\\
\delta_1=&\alpha_1\beta_0+\alpha_0\beta_1\\
\delta_2=&\alpha_0\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_1+\alpha_2\beta_0\\
\delta_3=&\alpha_1\beta_2+\alpha_2\beta_1+\alpha_0\beta_3\\
\delta_4=&\alpha_2\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_3\\
\delta_5=&\alpha_2\beta_3.\\
\end{split}
!et


We note that $\alpha_i=0$ except for $i\in \left\{0,1,2\right\}$ and $\beta_i=0$ except for $i\in\left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$.

We can then rewrite the coefficients $\delta_j$ using a discrete convolution as
!bt
\[
\delta_j = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{i=\infty}\alpha_i\beta_{j-i}=(\alpha * \beta)_j,
\]
!et
or as a double sum with restriction $l=i+j$
!bt
\[
\delta_l = \sum_{ij}\alpha_i\beta_{j}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Further simplification =====

Although we may have redundant operations with some few zeros for $\beta_i$, we can rewrite the above sum in a more compact way as 
!bt
\[
\delta_i = \sum_{k=0}^{k=m-1}\alpha_k\beta_{i-k},
\]
!et
where $m=3$ in our case, the maximum length of the vector $\alpha$. Note that the vector $\bm{\beta}$ has length $n=4$.

!split
===== A more efficient way of coding the above Convolution =====

Since we only have a finite number of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values
which are non-zero, we can rewrite the above convolution expressions
as a matrix-vector multiplication

!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                            \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 & 0 & 0 \\
			    \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 & 0 \\
			    0 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 \\
			    0 & 0 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 \\
			    0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_2
			    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \beta_3\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

The process is commutative and we can easily see that we can rewrite the multiplication in terms of  a matrix holding $\beta$ and a vector holding $\alpha$.
In this case we have
!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 & 0 & 0  \\
                            \beta_1 & \beta_0 & 0  \\
			    \beta_2 & \beta_1 & \beta_0  \\
			    \beta_3 & \beta_2 & \beta_1 \\
			    0 & \beta_3 & \beta_2 \\
			    0 & 0 & \beta_3
			    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Note that the use of these matrices is for mathematical purposes only
and not implementation purposes.  When implementing the above equation
we do not encode (and allocate memory) the matrices explicitely.  We
rather code the convolutions in the minimal memory footprint that they
require.





The above matrices are examples of so-called "Toeplitz
matrices":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-93-86279-04-0". A
Toeplitz matrix is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from
left to right is constant. For instance the last matrix, which we
rewrite as
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_0 & 0 & 0  \\
                            a_1 & a_0 & 0  \\
			    a_2 & a_1 & a_0  \\
			    a_3 & a_2 & a_1 \\
			    0 & a_3 & a_2 \\
			    0 & 0 & a_3
			    \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
with elements $a_{ii}=a_{i+1,j+1}=a_{i-j}$ is an example of a Toeplitz
matrix. Such a matrix does not need to be a square matrix.  Toeplitz
matrices are also closely connected with Fourier series, because the multiplication operator by a trigonometric
polynomial, compressed to a finite-dimensional space, can be
represented by such a matrix. The example above shows that we can
represent linear convolution as multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix by
a vector.

===== Generalizing the above one-dimensional case =====

In order to align the above simple case with the more general convolution cases, we rename $\bm{\alpha}$, whose length is $m=3$, with $\bm{w}$.
We will interpret $\bm{w}$ as a weight/filter function with which we want to perform the convolution with an input varibale $\bm{x}$.
We replace thus $\bm{\beta}$ with $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{\delta}$ with $\bm{s}$ and have
!bt
\[
s(i) \left(x*w\right)(i)= \sum_{k=0}^{k=m-1}w(k)x(i-k),
\]
!et
where $m=3$ in our case, the maximum length of the vector $\bm{w}$.
Here the symbol $*$ represents the mathematical operation of convolution.



=====  Two-dimensional Objects =====

We are now ready to start studying the discrete convolutions relevant for convolutional neural networks.
We often use convolutions over more than one dimension at a time. If
we have a two-dimensional image $X$ as input, we can have a _filter_
defined by a two-dimensional _kernel/weight/filter_ $W$. This leads to an output $Y$

!bt
\[
Y(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(m,n)W(i-m,j-n).
\]
!et

Convolution is a commutative process, which means we can rewrite this equation as
!bt
\[
Y(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(i-m,j-n)W(m,n).
\]
!et

Normally the latter is more straightforward to implement in  a machine larning library since there is less variation in the range of values of $m$ and $n$.


Many deep learning libraries implement cross-correlation instead of convolution (although it is referred to s convolution)
!bt
Y(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(i+m,j+n)W(m,n).
\]
!et



!split
===== CNNs in more detail =====


Let assume we have an input matrix $X$ of dimensionality $3\times 3$
and a $2\times 2$ filter $W$ given by the following matrices

!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00} & x_{01} & x_{02}  \\
                      x_{10} & x_{11} & x_{12}  \\
	              x_{20} & x_{21} & x_{22} \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\bm{W}=\begin{bmatrix}w_{00} & w_{01} \\
	              w_{10} & w_{11}\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We introduce now the hyperparameter $S$ _stride_. Stride represents how the filter $W$ moves the convolution process on the matrix $X$.
We strongly recommend the repository on "Arithmetic of deep learning by Dumoulin and Visin":"https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic" 

Here we set the stride equal to $S=1$, which means that, starting with the element $x_{00}$, the filter will act on $2\times 2$ submatrices each time, starting with the upper corner and moving according to the stride value column by column. 

Here we perform the operation
!bt
\[
Y_(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(i-m,j-n)W(m,n),
\]
!et
and obtain
!bt
\[
\bm{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00}w_{00}+x_{01}w_{01}+x_{10}w_{10}+x_{11}w_{11} & x_{01}w_{00}+x_{02}w_{01}+x_{11}w_{10}+x_{12}w_{11}  \\
	              x_{10}w_{00}+x_{11}w_{01}+x_{20}w_{10}+x_{21}w_{11} & x_{11}w_{00}+x_{12}w_{01}+x_{21}w_{10}+x_{22}w_{11}\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

We can rewrite this operation in terms of a matrix-vector multiplication by defining a new vector where we flatten out the inputs as a vector $\bm{X}'$ of length $9$ and
a matrix $\bm{W}'$ with dimension $4\times 9$ as

!bt
\[
\bm{X}'=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00} \\ x_{01} \\ x_{02} \\ x_{10} \\ x_{11} \\ x_{12} \\ x_{20} \\ x_{21} \\ x_{22} \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

and the new matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{W}'=\begin{bmatrix} w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0  & w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11} & 0  \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11}\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

We see easily that performing the matrix-vector multiplication $\bm{W}'\bm{X}'$ is the same as the above convolution with stride $S=1$, that is

!bt
\[
Y=(\bm{W}*\bm{X}),
\]
!et
is now given by $\bm{W}'\bm{X}'$ which is a vector of length $4$ instead of the originally resulting  $2\times 2$ output matrix.

!split
===== Set of filters =====

The collection of kernels/filters $W$ defining a discrete convolution has a shape
corresponding to some permutation of $(n, m, k_1, \ldots, k_N)$, where

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    n &\equiv \text{number of output feature maps},\\
    m &\equiv \text{number of input feature maps},\\
    k_j &\equiv \text{kernel size along axis $j$}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
!et

The following properties affect the output size $o_j$ of a convolutional layer
along axis $j$:

o $i_j$: input size along axis $j$,
o $k_j$: kernel/filter size along axis $j$,
o stride (distance between two consecutive positions of the kernel/filter) along axis $j$,
o zero padding (number of zeros concatenated at the beginning and at the end of an axis) along axis $j$.

For instance, the above examples shows a  $2\times 2$ kernel/filter $\bm{W}$  applied to a $3 \times 3$ input padded with a $0 \times 0$
border of zeros using $1 \times 1$ strides.

Note that strides constitute a form of _subsampling_. As an alternative to
being interpreted as a measure of how much the kernel/filter is translated, strides
can also be viewed as how much of the output is retained. For instance, moving
the kernel by hops of two is equivalent to moving the kernel by hops of one but
retaining only odd output elements.

!split
===== Pooling =====

In addition to discrete convolutions themselves, {\em pooling\/} operations
make up another important building block in CNNs. Pooling operations reduce
the size of feature maps by using some function to summarize subregions, such
as taking the average or the maximum value.

Pooling works by sliding a window across the input and feeding the content of
the window to a {\em pooling function}. In some sense, pooling works very much
like a discrete convolution, but replaces the linear combination described by
the kernel with some other function. Poolin
provides an example for average pooling, and 
does the same for max pooling.

The following properties affect the output size $o_j$ of a pooling layer
along axis $j$:


o $i_j$: input size along axis $j$,
o $k_j$: pooling window size along axis $j$,
o $s_j$: stride (distance between two consecutive positions of the pooling window) along axis $j$.



The analysis of the relationship between convolutional layer properties is eased
by the fact that they don't interact across axes, i.e., the choice of kernel
size, stride and zero padding along axis $j$ only affects the output size of
axis $j$. Because of that, we will focus on the following simplified
setting:


o 2-D discrete convolutions ($N = 2$),
o square inputs ($i_1 = i_2 = i$),
o square kernel size ($k_1 = k_2 = k$),
o same strides along both axes ($s_1 = s_2 = s$),
o same zero padding along both axes ($p_1 = p_2 = p$).

This facilitates the analysis and the visualization, but keep in mind that the
results outlined here also generalize to the N-D and non-square cases.

!split
===== No zero padding, unit strides =====

The simplest case to analyze is when the kernel just slides across every
position of the input (i.e., $s = 1$ and $p = 0$).



For any $i$ and $k$, and for $s = 1$ and $p = 0$,
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    o = (i - k) + 1.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Zero padding, unit strides =====

To factor in zero padding (i.e., only restricting to $s = 1$), let's consider
its effect on the effective input size: padding with $p$ zeros changes the
effective input size from $i$ to $i + 2p$. In the general case, we can infer the following
relationship

For any $i$, $k$ and $p$, and for $s = 1$,
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    o = (i - k) + 2p + 1.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Half (same) padding =====

Having the output size be the same as the input size (i.e., $o = i$) can be a
desirable property:

For any $i$ and for $k$ odd ($k = 2n + 1, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}$), $s = 1$ and
$p = \lfloor k / 2 \rfloor = n$,
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    o &= i + 2 \lfloor k / 2 \rfloor - (k - 1) \\
      &= i + 2n - 2n \\
      &= i.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
!et


!split
===== Full padding =====

While convolving a kernel generally decreases the output size with
respect to the input size, sometimes the opposite is required. This can be
achieved with proper zero padding:


For any $i$ and $k$, and for $p = k - 1$ and $s = 1$,
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    o &= i + 2(k - 1) - (k - 1) \\
      &= i + (k - 1).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
!et

This is sometimes referred to as full padding, because in this
setting every possible partial or complete superimposition of the kernel on the
input feature map is taken into account. 

!split
===== Pooling arithmetic =====

In a neural network, pooling layers provide invariance to small translations of
the input. The most common kind of pooling is _max pooling_, which
consists in splitting the input in (usually non-overlapping) patches and
outputting the maximum value of each patch. Other kinds of pooling exist, e.g.,
mean or average pooling, which all share the same idea of aggregating the input
locally by applying a non-linearity to the content of some patches.

Since pooling does not involve
zero padding, the relationship describing the general case is as follows:


For any $i$, $k$ and $s$,
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    o = \left\lfloor \frac{i - k}{s} \right\rfloor + 1.
\end{equation*}
!et
