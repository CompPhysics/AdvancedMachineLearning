===== Reminder on books with hands-on material and codes =====
!bblock
* "Sebastian Rashcka et al, Machine learning with Sickit-Learn and PyTorch":"https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.html"
* "David Foster, Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"

All three books have GitHub addresses from where  one can download all codes. We will borrow most of the material from these three texts as well as 
from Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville's text "Deep Learning":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/"


!split
===== Reading recommendations =====

o Rashkca et al., chapter 11, jupyter-notebook sent separately, from "GitHub":"https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book"
o Goodfellow et al, chapter 6 and 7 contain most of the neural network background.
