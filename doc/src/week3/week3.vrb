\frametitle{New expression for the derivative}

With these definitions we obtain the following partial derivatives
\[
\frac{\partial a}{\partial x} = 2x,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\partial b}{\partial a} = \exp{a},
\]
and
\[
\frac{\partial c}{\partial a} = 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\partial c}{\partial b} = 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\partial d}{\partial c} = \frac{1}{2\srqt{c}},
\]
and finally
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial d} = 1.
\]
