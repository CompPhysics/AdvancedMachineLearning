===== Gating mechanism: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, as discussed during the last two weeks, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".


LSTM uses a memory cell for  modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.
Capable of modeling longer term dependencies by having
memory cells and gates that controls the information flow along
with the memory cells.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 

The LSTM were first introduced to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.

!split
===== Implementing a memory cell in a neural network =====

To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives. 


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The LSTM is a unit cell that is made of three gates:
o the input gate,
o the forget gate,
o and the output gate.

It also introduces a cell state $c$, which can be thought of as the
long-term memory, and a hidden state $h$ which can be thought of as
the short-term memory.


!split
===== Basic layout (All figures from Raschka *et al.,*) =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM1.png, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The first stage is called the forget gate, where we combine the input
at (say, time $t$), and the hidden cell state input at $t-1$, passing
it through the Sigmoid activation function and then performing an
element-wise multiplication, denoted by $\odot$.

It follows 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_f\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_f\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where $W$ and $U$ are the weights respectively.

!split
===== Forget gate  =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM6.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== The forget gate =====

The naming forget gate stems from the fact that  the Sigmoid activation function's
outputs are very close to $0$ if the argument for the function is very
negative, and $1$ if the argument is very positive. Hence we can
control the amount of information we want to take from the long-term
memory.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM7.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Input gate =====

The next stage is the input gate, which consists of both a Sigmoid
function ($\sigma_i$), which decide what percentage of the input will
be stored in the long-term memory, and the $\tanh_i$ function, which
decide what is the full memory that can be stored in the long term
memory. When these results are calculated and multiplied together, it
is added to the cell state or stored in the long-term memory, denoted
as $\oplus$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\mathbf{i}^{(t)} = \sigma_g(W_i\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_i\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_i),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathbf{\tilde{c}}^{(t)} = \tanh(W_c\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_c\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_c),
\]
!et
again the $W$ and $U$ are the weights.




!split
===== Short summary  =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM8.png, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Forget and input =====

The forget gate and the input gate together also update the cell state with the following equation, 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{c}^{(t)} = \mathbf{f}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{c}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{i}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{\tilde{c}}^{(t)},
\]
!et
where $f^{(t)}$ and $i^{(t)}$ are the outputs of the forget gate and the input gate, respectively.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM9.png, width=700 frac=1.0]




!split
===== Output gate =====

The final stage of the LSTM is the output gate, and its purpose is to
update the short-term memory.  To achieve this, we take the newly
generated long-term memory and process it through a hyperbolic tangent
($\tanh$) function creating a potential new short-term memory. We then
multiply this potential memory by the output of the Sigmoid function
($\sigma_o$). This multiplication generates the final output as well
as the input for the next hidden cell ($h^{\langle t \rangle}$) within
the LSTM cell.

We have 
!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{o}^{(t)} &= \sigma_g(W_o\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_o\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_o), \\
\mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \mathbf{o}^{(t)} \otimes \sigma_h(\mathbf{c}^{(t)}). \\
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{W_o,U_o}$ are the weights of the output gate and $\mathbf{b_o}$ is the bias of the output gate.

===== Summary of LSTM =====

LSTMs provide a basic approach for modeling long-range dependencies in sequences.
If you wish to read more, see _An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures_, authored
by Rafal Jozefowicz *et al.,*  Proceedings of ICML, 2342-2350, 2015).

An important recent development are so-called noting is a more recent
method named _gated recurrent unit (GRU)_, se for example the article
by Junyoung Chung *et al.,*, at URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555.
This article is an excellent read if you are interested in learning
more about these modern RNN architectures

The GRUs have a simpler
architecture than LSTMs. This leads to computationally more efficient methods, while their
performance in some tasks, such as polyphonic music modeling, is comparable to LSTMs.

And recently Beck *et al.,* see URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517", have demonstrated that exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

Key points:
1. The input images (28x28 pixels) are treated as sequences of 28 timesteps with 28 features each
2. The LSTM layer processes this sequential data
3. A final dense layer with softmax activation handles the classification
4. Typical accuracy ranges between 95-98% (lower than CNNs but reasonable for demonstration)

Note: LSTMs are not typically used for image classification (CNNs are more efficient), but this demonstrates how to adapt them for such tasks. Training might take longer compared to CNN architectures.

To improve performance, you could:
1. Add more LSTM layers

===== Autoencoders: Overarching view =====

Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning
efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without
any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings
typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making
autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. 

Autoencoders learn to encode the
input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and then decode it
back to the original data. The goal of autoencoders is to minimize the
reconstruction error, which measures how well the output matches the
input. Autoencoders can be seen as a way of learning the latent
features or hidden structure of the data, and they can be used for
data compression, denoising, anomaly detection, and generative
modeling.

!split
===== Powerful detectors =====

More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and
they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.

Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks
very similar to the training data; this is called a generative
model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of
faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,
autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their
outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that
constraining the network in various ways can make it rather
difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal
representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the
network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the
autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,
which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In
short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s attempt to
learn the identity function under some constraints.




!split
===== First introduction of AEs =====

Autoencoders were first introduced by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams
in 1986 with the goal of learning to reconstruct the input
observations with the lowest error possible.


Why would one want to learn to reconstruct the input observations? If
you have problems imagining what that means, think of having a dataset
made of images. An autoencoder would be an algorithm that can give as
output an image that is as similar as possible to the input one. You
may be confused, as there is no apparent reason of doing so. To better
understand why autoencoders are useful we need a more informative
(although not yet unambiguous) definition.

!bblock
An autoencoder is a type of algorithm with the primary purpose of learning an "informative" representation of the data that can be used for different applications ("see Bank, D., Koenigstein, N., and Giryes, R., Autoencoders":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05991") by learning to reconstruct a set of input observations well enough.
!eblock



!split
===== Autoencoder structure =====


Autoencoders are neural networks where the outputs are its own
inputs. They are split into an _encoder part_
which maps the input $\bm{x}$ via a function $f(\bm{x},\bm{W})$ (this
is the encoder part) to a _so-called code part_ (or intermediate part)
with the result $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W})),
\]
!et
where $\bm{W}$ are the weights to be determined.  The _decoder_ parts maps, via its own parameters (weights given by the matrix $\bm{V}$ and its own biases) to 
the final ouput
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V})).
\]
!et

The goal is to minimize the construction error.

!split
===== Schematic image of an Autoencoder =====

FIGURE: [figures/ae1.png, width=700 frac=1.0]



!split
===== More on the structure =====

In most typical architectures, the encoder and the decoder are neural networks
since they can be easily trained with existing software libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch with back propagation.



In general, the encoder can be written as a function $g$ that will depend on some parameters
!bt
\[
\mathbf{h}_{i} = g(\mathbf{x}_{i}),
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{h}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{q}$  (the latent feature representation) is the output of the encoder block where we evaluate
it using the input $\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

!split
===== Decoder part =====

Note that we have $g:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{q}$
The decoder and the output of the network $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}$ can be written then as a second generic function
of the latent features
!bt
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} = f\left(\mathbf{h}_{i}\right) = f\left(g\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)\right),
\]
!et
where $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\mathbf{\in }\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

Training an autoencoder simply means finding the functions $g(\cdot)$ and $f(\cdot)$
that satisfy
!bt
\[
\textrm{arg}\min_{f,g}<\left[\Delta (\mathbf{x}_{i}, f(g\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right))\right]>.
\]
!et


!split
===== Typical AEs =====

The standard setup is done via a standard feed forward neural network (FFNN), or what is called a Feed Forward Autoencoder.

A typical FFNN architecture has an odd number of layers and is symmetrical with respect to the middle layer.

Typically, the first layer has a number of neurons $n_{1} = n$ which equals the size of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}$.

As we move toward the center of the network, the number of neurons in each layer drops in some measure.
The middle layer usually has the smallest number of neurons.
The fact that the number of neurons in this layer is smaller than the size of the input, is often called the _bottleneck_.

!split
===== Feed Forward Autoencoder =====

FIGURE: [figures/ae2.pdf, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Mirroring =====

In almost all practical applications,
the layers after the middle one are a mirrored version of the layers before the middle one.
For example, an autoencoder with three layers could have the following numbers of neurons:

$n_{1} = 10$, $n_{2} = 5$ and then $n_{3} = n_{1} = 10$ where the input dimension is equal to ten.


All the layers up to and including the middle one, make what is called the encoder, and all the layers from and including
the middle one (up to the output) make what is called the decoder.

If the FFNN training is successful, the result will
be a good approximation of the input $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\approx\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

What is essential to notice is that the decoder can reconstruct the
input by using only a much smaller number of features than the input
observations initially have.

!split
===== Output of middle layer =====

The output of the middle layer
$\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{i}}$ are also called a _learned representation_ of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

The encoder can reduce the number of dimensions of the input
observation and create a learned representation
$\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{) }$ of the input that has a smaller
dimension $q<n$.

This learned representation is enough for the decoder to reconstruct
the input accurately (if the autoencoder training was successful as
intended).

!split
===== Activation Function of the Output Layer =====

In autoencoders based on neural networks, the output layer's
activation function plays a particularly important role.  The most
used functions are ReLU and Sigmoid. 

!split
===== ReLU =====

The  ReLU activation function can assume all values in the range $\left[0,\infty\right]$. As a remainder, its formula is
!bt
\[
\textrm{ReLU}\left(x\right) = \max\left(0,x\right).
\]
!et
This choice is good when the input observations \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) assume a wide range of positive values.
If the input $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ can assume negative values, the ReLU is, of course, a terrible choice, and the identity function is a much better choice. It is then common to replace to the ReLU with the so-called _Leaky ReLu_ or just modified ReLU.

The ReLU activation function for the output layer is well suited for cases when the input observations \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) assume a wide range of positive real values.  

!split
===== Sigmoid =====

The sigmoid function $\sigma$ can assume all values in the range $[0,1]$,
!bt
\[
\sigma\left(x\right) =\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.
\]
!et


This activation function can only be used if the input observations
$\mathbf{x}_{i}$ are all in the range $[0,1]$  or if you have
normalized them to be in that range. Consider as an example the MNIST
dataset. Each value of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ (one
image) is the gray values of the pixels that can assume any value from
0 to 255. Normalizing the data by dividing the pixel values by 255
would make each observation (each image) have only pixel values
between 0 and 1. In this case, the sigmoid would be a good choice for
the output layer's activation function.

!split
===== Cost/Loss Function =====

If an autoencoder is trying to solve a regression problem, the most
common choice as a loss function is the Mean Square Error

!bt
\[
L_{\textrm{MSE}} = \textrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left\vert\vert\mathbf{x}_{i}-\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\right\vert\vert^{2}_2.
\]
!et


!split
===== Binary Cross-Entropy =====

If the activation function of the output layer of the AE is a sigmoid
function, thus limiting neuron outputs to be between 0 and 1, and the
input features are normalized to be between 0 and 1 we can use as loss
function the binary cross-entropy. This cots/loss function is
typically used in classification problems, but it works well for
autoencoders. The formula for it is

!bt
\[
L_{\textrm{CE}} = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{p}[x_{j,i} \log\tilde{x}_{j,i}+\left(1-x_{j,i}\right)\log (1-\tilde{x}_{j,i})].
\]
!et

!split
===== Reconstruction Error =====

The reconstruction error (RE) is a metric that gives you an indication of how good (or bad) the autoencoder was able to reconstruct
the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$. The most typical RE used is the MSE

!bt
\[
\textrm{RE}\equiv \textrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left\vert\vert\mathbf{x}_{i}-\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\right\vert\vert^{2}_2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Implementation using TensorFlow =====

The code here has the following structure
o Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to a range of $[0, 1]$. Each image is reshaped into a flat vector.
o Model Definition: An autoencoder architecture is defined with an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs it back to its original form.
o Training: The model is trained using binary crossentropy as the loss function over several epochs.
o Visualization: After training completes, it visualizes original images alongside their reconstructions.

===== Implementation using PyTorch =====

The code here as the same structure as the previous one which uses TensorFlow.
o Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded with normalization applied.
o Model Definition: An *Autoencoder* class defines both encoder and decoder networks.
o Training part: The network is trained over several epochs using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
o Visualization: After training completes, it visualizes original images alongside their reconstructions.

===== Dimensionality reduction and links with Principal component analysis =====

The hope is that the training of the autoencoder can unravel some
useful properties of the function $f$. They are often trained with
only single-layer neural networks (although deep networks can improve
the training) and are essentially given by feed forward neural
networks.

!split
===== Linear functions =====

If the function $f$ and $g$ are given by a linear dependence on the
weight matrices $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{V}$, we can show that for a
regression case, by miminizing the mean squared error between $\bm{x}$
and $\tilde{\bm{x}}$, the autoencoder learns the same subspace as the
standard principal component analysis (PCA).

In order to see this, we define then
!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W}))=\bm{W}\bm{x},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V}))=\bm{V}\bm{h}=\bm{V}\bm{W}\bm{x}.
\]
!et

!split
===== AE mean-squared error =====

With the above linear dependence we can in turn define our
optimization problem in terms of the optimization of the mean-squared
error, that is we wish to optimize

!bt
\[
\min_{\bm{W},\bm{V}\in {\mathbb{R}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(x_i-\tilde{x}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{x}-\bm{V}\bm{W}\bm{x}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Dimensionality reduction =====

This is equivalent to our functions learning the same subspace as
the PCA method. This means that we can interpret AEs as a
dimensionality reduction method.  To see this, we need to remind
ourselves about the PCA method.


!split
===== What is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? =====

PCA is a linear transformation that finds the directions of maximum
variance in the data, and projects the data onto a lower-dimensional
space. These directions are called principal components, and they are
orthogonal to each other. PCA can be seen as a way of compressing the
data by discarding the components that have low variance and retain
the most important ones. PCA can be applied to both supervised and
unsupervised learning problems, and it is often used for data
visualization, feature extraction, and noise reduction.

A linear autoencoder can be shown to be equal to the PCA.
In this lectures we will try to expose these ideas.

!split
===== Basic ideas of the PCA =====

The principal component analysis deals with the problem of fitting a
low-dimensional affine subspace $S$ of dimension $d$ much smaller than
the total dimension $D$ of the problem at hand (our data
set). Mathematically it can be formulated as a statistical problem or
a geometric problem.  In our discussion of the theorem for the
classical PCA, we will stay with a statistical approach. 
Historically, the PCA was first formulated in a statistical setting in order to estimate the principal component of a multivariate random variable.


!split
===== Ingredients of the PCA =====

We have a data set defined by a design/feature matrix $\bm{X}$ (see below for its definition) 
o Each data point is determined by $p$ extrinsic (measurement) variables
o We may want to ask the following question: Are there fewer intrinsic variables (say $d << p$) that still approximately describe the data?
o If so, these intrinsic variables may tell us something important and finding these intrinsic variables is what dimension reduction methods do. 

A good read is for example "Vidal, Ma and Sastry":"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387878102".


!split
===== Introducing the Covariance and Correlation functions  =====

Before we discuss the PCA theorem, we need to remind ourselves about
the definition of the covariance and the correlation function. These are quantities 

Suppose we have defined two vectors
$\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ with $n$ elements each. The covariance matrix $\bm{C}$ is defined as 
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] = \begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{x}] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] \\
                              \mathrm{cov}[\bm{y},\bm{x}] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{y},\bm{y}] \\
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where for example
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i- \overline{x})(y_i- \overline{y}).
\]
!et


!split
===== Covariance matrix =====

With this definition and recalling that the variance is defined as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}[\bm{x}]=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i- \overline{x})^2,
\]
!et
we can rewrite the covariance matrix as 
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] = \begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] \\
                              \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] & \mathrm{var}[\bm{y}] \\
             \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
=====  More on the covariance =====
The covariance takes values between zero and infinity and may thus
lead to problems with loss of numerical precision for particularly
large values. It is common to scale the covariance matrix by
introducing instead the correlation matrix defined via the so-called
correlation function

!bt
\[
\mathrm{corr}[\bm{x},\bm{y}]=\frac{\mathrm{cov}[\bm{x},\bm{y}]}{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}[\bm{x}] \mathrm{var}[\bm{y}]}}.
\]
!et

The correlation function is then given by values $\mathrm{corr}[\bm{x},\bm{y}]
\in [-1,1]$. This avoids eventual problems with too large values. We
can then define the correlation matrix for the two vectors $\bm{x}$
and $\bm{y}$ as

!bt
\[
\bm{K}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x},\bm{y}] \\
                              \mathrm{corr}[\bm{y},\bm{x}] & 1 \\
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

In the above example this is the function we constructed using _pandas_.

!split
=====  Reminding ourselves about Linear Regression =====
In our derivation of the various regression algorithms like _Ordinary Least Squares_ or _Ridge regression_
we defined the design/feature matrix $\bm{X}$ as

!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{0,0} & x_{0,1} & x_{0,2}& \dots & \dots x_{0,p-1}\\
x_{1,0} & x_{1,1} & x_{1,2}& \dots & \dots x_{1,p-1}\\
x_{2,0} & x_{2,1} & x_{2,2}& \dots & \dots x_{2,p-1}\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \dots & \dots \\
x_{n-2,0} & x_{n-2,1} & x_{n-2,2}& \dots & \dots x_{n-2,p-1}\\
x_{n-1,0} & x_{n-1,1} & x_{n-1,2}& \dots & \dots x_{n-1,p-1}\\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
with $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n\times p}$, with the predictors/features $p$  refering to the column numbers and the
entries $n$ being the row elements.


!split
===== Rewriting the matrix $\bm{X}$ =====

We can rewrite the design/feature matrix in terms of its column vectors as
!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix} \bm{x}_0 & \bm{x}_1 & \bm{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & \bm{x}_{p-1}\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
with a given vector
!bt
\[
\bm{x}_i^T = \begin{bmatrix}x_{0,i} & x_{1,i} & x_{2,i}& \dots & \dots x_{n-1,i}\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Simple Example =====

With these definitions, we can now rewrite our $2\times 2$
correlation/covariance matrix in terms of a moe general design/feature
matrix $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n\times p}$. This leads to a $p\times p$
covariance matrix for the vectors $\bm{x}_i$ with $i=0,1,\dots,p-1$

!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x}] = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_0] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_1]  & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_2] & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_0] & \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_1]  & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2] & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_0]   & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_1] & \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_2] & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_0]   & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_1] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_{2}]  & \dots & \dots  & \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== The Correlation Matrix =====

The correlation matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{K}[\bm{x}] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_1]  & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_2] & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_0] & 1  & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2] & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_0]   & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_1] & 1 & \dots & \dots & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_{p-1}]\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_0]   & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_1] & \mathrm{corr}[\bm{x}_{p-1},\bm{x}_{2}]  & \dots & \dots  & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Numpy Functionality =====

The Numpy function _np.cov_ calculates the covariance elements using
the factor $1/(n-1)$ instead of $1/n$ since it assumes we do not have
the exact mean values.  The following simple function uses the
_np.vstack_ function which takes each vector of dimension $1\times n$
and produces a $2\times n$ matrix $\bm{W}$


!bt
\[
\bm{W}^T = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 & y_0 \\
                          x_1 & y_1 \\
                          x_2 & y_2\\
                          \dots & \dots \\
                          x_{n-2} & y_{n-2}\\
                          x_{n-1} & y_{n-1} & 
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

which in turn is converted into into the $2\times 2$ covariance matrix
$\bm{C}$ via the Numpy function _np.cov()_. We note that we can also calculate
the mean value of each set of samples $\bm{x}$ etc using the Numpy
function _np.mean(x)_. We can also extract the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix through the _np.linalg.eig()_ function.

!bc pycod
# Importing various packages
import numpy as np
n = 100
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
print(np.mean(x))
y = 4+3*x+np.random.normal(size=n)
print(np.mean(y))
W = np.vstack((x, y))
C = np.cov(W)
print(C)
!ec


!split
===== Correlation Matrix again  =====

The previous example can be converted into the correlation matrix by
simply scaling the matrix elements with the variances.  We should also
subtract the mean values for each column. This leads to the following
code which sets up the correlations matrix for the previous example in
a more brute force way. Here we scale the mean values for each column of the design matrix, calculate the relevant mean values and variances and then finally set up the $2\times 2$ correlation matrix (since we have only two vectors). 

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 100
# define two vectors                                                                                           
x = np.random.random(size=n)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.normal(size=n)
#scaling the x and y vectors                                                                                   
x = x - np.mean(x)
y = y - np.mean(y)
variance_x = np.sum(x@x)/n
variance_y = np.sum(y@y)/n
print(variance_x)
print(variance_y)
cov_xy = np.sum(x@y)/n
cov_xx = np.sum(x@x)/n
cov_yy = np.sum(y@y)/n
C = np.zeros((2,2))
C[0,0]= cov_xx/variance_x
C[1,1]= cov_yy/variance_y
C[0,1]= cov_xy/np.sqrt(variance_y*variance_x)
C[1,0]= C[0,1]
print(C)
!ec

We see that the matrix elements along the diagonal are one as they
should be and that the matrix is symmetric. Furthermore, diagonalizing
this matrix we easily see that it is a positive definite matrix.

The above procedure with _numpy_ can be made more compact if we use _pandas_.

!split
===== Using Pandas =====

We whow here how we can set up the correlation matrix using _pandas_, as done in this simple code
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
n = 10
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
x = x - np.mean(x)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.normal(size=n)
y = y - np.mean(y)
X = (np.vstack((x, y))).T
print(X)
Xpd = pd.DataFrame(X)
print(Xpd)
correlation_matrix = Xpd.corr()
print(correlation_matrix)
!ec

!split
===== Links with the Design Matrix =====

We can rewrite the covariance matrix in a more compact form in terms of the design/feature matrix $\bm{X}$ as 
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x}] = \frac{1}{n}\bm{X}^T\bm{X}= \mathbb{E}[\bm{X}^T\bm{X}].
\]
!et

To see this let us simply look at a design matrix $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{2\times 2}$
!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{00} & x_{01}\\
x_{10} & x_{11}\\
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
\bm{x}_{0} & \bm{x}_{1}\\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Computing the Expectation Values =====

If we then compute the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\bm{X}^T\bm{X}] = \frac{1}{n}\bm{X}^T\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{00}^2+x_{01}^2 & x_{00}x_{10}+x_{01}x_{11}\\
x_{10}x_{00}+x_{11}x_{01} & x_{10}^2+x_{11}^2\\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
which is just 
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_1] = \bm{C}[\bm{x}]=\begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_0] & \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_1] \\
                              \mathrm{cov}[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_0] & \mathrm{var}[\bm{x}_1] \\
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where we wrote $$\bm{C}[\bm{x}_0,\bm{x}_1] = \bm{C}[\bm{x}]$$ to indicate that this the covariance of the vectors $\bm{x}$ of the design/feature matrix $\bm{X}$.

It is easy to generalize this to a matrix $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n\times p}$.


!split
===== Towards the PCA theorem =====

We have that the covariance matrix (the correlation matrix involves a simple rescaling) is given as
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{x}] = \frac{1}{n}\bm{X}^T\bm{X}= \mathbb{E}[\bm{X}^T\bm{X}].
\]
!et
Let us now assume that we can perform a series of orthogonal transformations where we employ some orthogonal matrices $\bm{S}$.
These matrices are defined as $\bm{S}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p\times p}$ and obey the orthogonality requirements $\bm{S}\bm{S}^T=\bm{S}^T\bm{S}=\bm{I}$. The matrix can be written out in terms of the column vectors $\bm{s}_i$ as $\bm{S}=[\bm{s}_0,\bm{s}_1,\dots,\bm{s}_{p-1}]$ and $\bm{s}_i \in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}$.

!split
===== More details =====

Assume also that there is a transformation $\bm{S}^T\bm{C}[\bm{x}]\bm{S}=\bm{C}[\bm{y}]$ such that the new matrix $\bm{C}[\bm{y}]$ is diagonal with elements $[\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_{p-1}]$.  

That is we have
!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{y}] = \mathbb{E}[\bm{S}^T\bm{X}^T\bm{X}T\bm{S}]=\bm{S}^T\bm{C}[\bm{x}]\bm{S},
\]
!et
since the matrix $\bm{S}$ is not a data dependent matrix.   Multiplying with $\bm{S}$ from the left we have
!bt
\[
\bm{S}\bm{C}[\bm{y}] = \bm{C}[\bm{x}]\bm{S},
\]
!et
and since $\bm{C}[\bm{y}]$ is diagonal we have for a given eigenvalue $i$ of the covariance matrix that

!bt
\[
\bm{S}_i\lambda_i = \bm{C}[\bm{x}]\bm{S}_i.
\]
!et
