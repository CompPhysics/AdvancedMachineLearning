===== Reminder from last week, what is a GAN? =====

A GAN is a deep neural network which consists of two networks, a
so-called generator network and a discriminating network, or just
discriminator. Through several iterations of generation and
discrimination, the idea is that these networks will train each other,
while also trying to outsmart each other.

In its simplest version, the two networks could be two standard neural networks with a given number of hidden of hidden layers and parameters to train.
The generator we have trained can then be used to produce new images.

!split
===== Labeling the networks =====

For a GAN we have: 
o a discriminator $D$ estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It attempts at discriminating the trained data by the generator and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones (our data set). We say a  discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and those generated by the abovementioned generator.
o a generator $G$ outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input $z$ ($z$ brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution in order to generate samples that can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.

At the end of the training, the generator can be used to generate for
example new images. In this sense we have trained a model which can
produce new samples. We say that we have implicitely defined a
probability.


!split
===== Which data? =====

GANs are generally a form of unsupervised machine learning, although
they also incorporate aspects of supervised learning. Internally the
discriminator sets up a supervised learning problem. Its goal is to
learn to distinguish between the two classes of generated data and
original data. The generator then considers this classification
problem and tries to find adversarial examples, that is  samples which
will be misclassified by the discriminator.

One can also design GAN architectures which work in a
semi-supervised learning setting. A semi-supervised learning environment includes both labeled and unlabeled data.
See URL:"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/8a3363abe792db2d8761d6403605aeb7-Paper.pdf" for a further discussion.



Thus, GANs can be used both on labeled and on unlabeled data and are used in three most commonly used contexts, that is
o with labeled data (supervised training)
o with unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)
o a with a mix labed and unlabeled  data

!split
===== Improving functionalities =====

These two models compete against each other during the training
process: the generator $G$ is trying hard to trick the discriminator,
while the critic model $D$ is trying hard not to be cheated. This
interesting zero-sum game between two models motivates both to improve
their functionalities.

!split
===== Setup of the GAN =====

We define a probability $p_{\bm{h}}$ which is used by the
generator. Usually it is given by a uniform distribution over the
input input $\bm{h}$. Thereafter we define the distribution of the
generator which we want to train, $p_{g}$ This is the generator's
distribution over the data $\bm{x}$. Finally, we have the distribution
$p_{r}$ over the real sample $\bm{x}$

!split
===== Optimization part =====

On one hand, we want to make sure the discriminator $D$'s decisions
over real data are accurate by maximizing $\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim
p_{r}(\bm{x})} [\log D(\bm{x})]$. Meanwhile, given a fake sample $G(\bm{h}), \bm{h} \sim
p_{\bm{h}}(\bm{h})$, the discriminator is expected to output a probability,
$D(G(\bm{h}))$, close to zero by maximizing $\mathbb{E}_{\bm{h} \sim p_{\bm{h}}(\bm{h})}
[\log (1 - D(G(\bm{h})))]$.

On the other hand, the generator is trained to increase the chances of
$D$ producing a high probability for a fake example, thus to minimize
$\mathbb{E}_{\bm{h} \sim p_{\bm{h}}(\bm{h})} [\log (1 - D(G(\bm{h})))]$.

!split
===== Minimax game =====

When combining both aspects together, $D$ and $G$ are playing a _minimax game_ in which we should optimize the following loss function:

!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_G \max_D L(D, G) 
& = \mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim p_{r}(\bm{x})} [\log D(\bm{x})] + \mathbb{E}_{\bm{h} \sim p_{\bm{h}}(\bm{h})} [\log(1 - D(G(\bm{h})))] \\
& = \mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim p_{r}(\bm{x})} [\log D(\bm{x})] + \mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim p_g(\bm{x})} [\log(1 - D(\bm{x})]
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim p_{r}(\bm{x})} [\log D(\bm{x})]$ has no impact on $G$ during gradient descent updates.

!split
===== Optimal value for $D$ =====

Now we have a well-defined loss function. Let's first examine what is the best value for $D$.

!bt
\[
L(G, D) = \int_{\bm{x}} \bigg( p_{r}(\bm{x}) \log(D(\bm{x})) + p_g (\bm{x}) \log(1 - D(\bm{x})) \bigg) dx
\]
!et

!split
===== Best value of $D$ =====
Since we are interested in what is the best value of $D(\bm{x})$ to maximize $L(G, D)$, let us label 

!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = D(\bm{x}), 
A=p_{r}(\bm{x}), 
B=p_g(\bm{x})
\]
!et

!split
===== Ignore integral =====

And then what is inside the integral (we can safely ignore the integral because $\bm{x}$ is sampled over all the possible values) is:

!bt
\begin{align*}
f(\tilde{\bm{x}}) 
& = A \log{\tilde{\bm{x}}} + B \log{(1-\tilde{\bm{x}})} \\
\frac{d f(\tilde{\bm{x}})}{d \tilde{\bm{x}}} & = A \frac{1}{\tilde{\bm{x}}} - B\frac{1}{1 - \tilde{\bm{x}}} \\
& = \frac{A - (A + B)\tilde{\bm{x}}} {\tilde{\bm{x}} (1 - \tilde{\bm{x}})}. \\
\end{align*}
!et


!split
===== Best values =====

Thus, if we set $\frac{d f(\tilde{\bm{x}})}{d \tilde{\bm{x}}} = 0$, we get
the best value of the discriminator: $D^*(\bm{x}) = \tilde{\bm{x}}^* =
\frac{A}{A + B} = \frac{p_{r}(\bm{x})}{p_{r}(\bm{x}) + p_g(\bm{x})}
\in [0, 1]$.  Once the generator is trained to its optimal, $p_g$ gets
very close to $p_{r}$. When $p_g = p_{r}$, $D^*(\bm{x})$ becomes
$1/2$. We will observe this when running the code below here.


When both $G$ and $D$ are at their optimal values, we have $p_g = p_{r}$ and $D^*(\bm{x}) = 1/2$ and the loss function becomes:

!bt
\begin{align*}
L(G, D^*) 
&= \int_{\bm{x}} \bigg( p_{r}(\bm{x}) \log(D^*(\bm{x})) + p_g (\bm{x}) \log(1 - D^*(\bm{x})) \bigg) d\bm{x} \\
&= \log \frac{1}{2} \int_{\bm{h}} p_{r}(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} + \log \frac{1}{2} \int_{\bm{x}} p_g(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} \\
&= -2\log2
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== What does the Loss Function Represent? =====

The JS divergence between $p_{r}$ and $p_g$ can be computed as:

!bt
\begin{align*}
D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) 
=& \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{r} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{g} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) \\
=& \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_{r}(\bm{x}) \log \frac{p_{r}(\bm{x})}{p_{r} + p_g(\bm{x})} d\bm{x} \bigg) + \\& \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_g(\bm{x}) \log \frac{p_g(\bm{x})}{p_{r} + p_g(\bm{x})} d\bm{x} \bigg) \\
=& \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log4 + L(G, D^*) \bigg)
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== What does the loss function quantify? =====

We have 
!bt
\[
L(G, D^*) = 2D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) - 2\log2.
\]
!et

Essentially the loss function of GAN quantifies the similarity between
the generative data distribution $p_g$ and the real sample
distribution $p_{r}$ by JS divergence when the discriminator is
optimal. The best $G^*$ that replicates the real data distribution
leads to the minimum $L(G^*, D^*) = -2\log2$ which is aligned with
equations above.

===== Pros and Cons of GANs =====


!split
===== Diffusion models, basics =====

Diffusion models are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. They
define a Markov chain of diffusion steps to slowly add random noise to
data and then learn to reverse the diffusion process to construct
desired data samples from the noise. Unlike VAE or flow models,
diffusion models are learned with a fixed procedure and the latent
variable has high dimensionality (same as the original data).


!split
=====  Problems with probabilistic models =====

Historically, probabilistic models suffer from a tradeoff between two
conflicting objectives: \textit{tractability} and
\textit{flexibility}. Models that are \textit{tractable} can be
analytically evaluated and easily fit to data (e.g. a Gaussian or
Laplace). However, these models are unable to aptly describe structure
in rich datasets. On the other hand, models that are \textit{flexible}
can be molded to fit structure in arbitrary data. For example, we can
define models in terms of any (non-negative) function $\phi(\bm{x})$
yielding the flexible distribution $p\left(\bm{x}\right) =
\frac{\phi\left(\bm{x} \right)}{Z}$, where $Z$ is a normalization
constant. However, computing this normalization constant is generally
intractable. Evaluating, training, or drawing samples from such
flexible models typically requires a very expensive Monte Carlo
process.

!split
===== Diffusion models =====
Diffusion models have several interesting features
* extreme flexibility in model structure,
* exact sampling,
* easy multiplication with other distributions, e.g. in order to compute a posterior, and
* the model log likelihood, and the probability of individual states, to be cheaply evaluated.

!split
===== Original idea =====

In the original formulation, one uses a Markov chain to gradually
convert one distribution into another, an idea used in non-equilibrium
statistical physics and sequential Monte Carlo. Diffusion models build
a generative Markov chain which converts a simple known distribution
(e.g. a Gaussian) into a target (data) distribution using a diffusion
process. Rather than use this Markov chain to approximately evaluate a
model which has been otherwise defined, one can  explicitly define the
probabilistic model as the endpoint of the Markov chain. Since each
step in the diffusion chain has an analytically evaluable probability,
the full chain can also be analytically evaluated.

!split
===== Diffusion learning =====

Learning in this framework involves estimating small perturbations to
a diffusion process. Estimating small, analytically tractable,
perturbations is more tractable than explicitly describing the full
distribution with a single, non-analytically-normalizable, potential
function.  Furthermore, since a diffusion process exists for any
smooth target distribution, this method can capture data distributions
of arbitrary form.
