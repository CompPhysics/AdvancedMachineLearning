===== "Additional topics:  Kernel regression (Gaussian processes) and Bayesian statistics":"https://jenfb.github.io/bkmr/overview.html" =====

Kernel machine regression (KMR), also called Gaussian process
regression, is a popular tool in the machine learning literature. The
main idea behind KMR is to flexibly model the relationship between a
large number of variables and a particular outcome (dependent
variable).

!split
===== Scientific Machine Learning =====

An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al "Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, Big Data 5, 787421 (2022)":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2022.787421"

!bblock
The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science -- the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas

o applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;
o techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;
o and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.

!split
===== Physics driven Machine Learning =====

Another hot topic is what has loosely been dubbed _Physics-driven deep learning_. See the recent work on "Learning nonlinear operators via DeepONet based on the universal approximation theorem of operators, Nature Machine Learning, vol 3, 218 (2021)":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5".

!bblock From their abstract
A less known but powerful result is that an NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. ...  We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations.

!split
===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.

An emerging  third category is  *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
!eblock

!split
===== Main categories =====
!bblock
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

!split
===== What Is Generative Modeling? =====


Generative modeling can be broadly defined as follows:

Generative modeling is a branch of machine learning that involves
training a model to produce new data that is similar to a given
dataset.

What does this mean in practice? Suppose we have a dataset containing
photos of horses. We can train a generative model on this dataset to
capture the rules that govern the complex relationships between pixels
in images of horses. Then we can sample from this model to create
novel, realistic images of horses that did not exist in the original
dataset. 

!split
===== Example of generative modeling, "taken from Generative Deeep Learning by David Foster":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"  =====

FIGURE: [figures/generativelearning.png, width=900 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Generative Modeling =====


In order to build a generative model, we require a dataset consisting
of many examples of the entity we are trying to generate. This is
known as the training data, and one such data point is called an
observation.

Each observation consists of many features. For an image generation
problem, the features are usually the individual pixel values; for a
text generation problem, the features could be individual words or
groups of letters. It is our goal to build a model that can generate
new sets of features that look as if they have been created using the
same rules as the original data. Conceptually, for image generation
this is an incredibly difficult task, considering the vast number of
ways that individual pixel values can be assigned and the relatively
tiny number of such arrangements that constitute an image of the
entity we are trying to generate.


!split
===== Generative Versus Discriminative Modeling =====

In order to truly understand what generative modeling aims to achieve
and why this is important, it is useful to compare it to its
counterpart, discriminative modeling. If you have studied machine
learning, most problems you will have faced will have most likely been
discriminative in nature. 


!split
===== Example of discriminative modeling, "taken from Generative Deeep Learning by David Foster":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"  =====


FIGURE: [figures/standarddeeplearning.png, width=900 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Discriminative Modeling =====

When performing discriminative modeling, each observation in the
training data has a label. For a binary classification problem such as
our data could be labeled as ones and zeros. Our model then learns how to
discriminate between these two groups and outputs the probability that
a new observation has label 1 or 0

In contrast, generative modeling doesn’t require the dataset to be
labeled because it concerns itself with generating entirely new
data (for example an image), rather than trying to predict a label for say  a given image.







!split
===== Taxonomy of generative deep learning, "taken from Generative Deep Learning by David Foster":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"  =====

FIGURE: [figures/generativemodels.png, width=900 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Possible paths for the projects =====

The differential equation path: Here we propose a set of differential
equations (ordinary and/or partial) to be solved first using neural
networks (using either your own code or TensorFlow/Pytorch or similar
libraries). Thereafter we can extend the set of methods for
solving these equations to recurrent neural networks and autoencoders
(AE) and/or Generalized Adversarial Networks (GANs). All these
approaches can be expanded into one large project. This project can
also be extended into including "Physics informed machine
learning":"https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs". Here we can discuss
neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks
while respecting any given law of physics described by general
nonlinear partial differential equations.

For those interested in mathematical aspects of deep learning, this could also be included.

!split
===== Paths for projects, writing own codes =====

The computational path: Here we propose a path where you develop your
own code for a convolutional or eventually recurrent neural network
and apply this to data selects of your own selection. The code should
be object oriented and flexible allowing for eventual extensions by
including different Loss/Cost functions and other
functionalities. Feel free to select data sets from those suggested
below here. This code can also be extended upon by adding for example
autoencoders. You can compare your own codes with implementations
using TensorFlow(Keras)/PyTorch or other libraries.

!split
===== The application path =====

The application path: Here you can use the most relevant method(s)
(say convolutional neural networks for images) and apply this(these)
to data sets relevant for your own research.

!split
===== Gaussian processes and Bayesian analysis =====

The Gaussian processes/Bayesian statistics path: "Kernel regression
(Gaussian processes) and Bayesian
statistics":"https://jenfb.github.io/bkmr/overview.html" are popular
tools in the machine learning literature. The main idea behind these
approaches is to flexibly model the relationship between a large
number of variables and a particular outcome (dependent
variable). This can form a second part of a project where for example
standard Kernel regression methods are used on a specific data
set. Alternatively, participants can opt to work on a large project
relevant for their own research using gaussian processes and/or
Bayesian machine Learning.

!split
===== HPC path =====

Another alternative is to study high-performance computing aspects in
designing ML codes. This can also be linked with an exploration of
mathematical aspects of deep learning methods.

!split
===== What are the basic Machine Learning ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\bm{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\bm{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. 
!eblock

!split
===== Low-level machine learning, the family of ordinary least squares methods  =====

Our data which we want to apply a machine learning method on, consist
of a set of inputs $\bm{x}^T=[x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ and the
outputs we want to model $\bm{y}^T=[y_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{n-1}]$.
We assume  that the output data can be represented (for a regression case) by a continuous function $f$
through
!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\bm{x})+\bm{\epsilon}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the equations =====

In linear regression we approximate the unknown function with another
continuous function $\tilde{\bm{y}}(\bm{x})$ which depends linearly on
some unknown parameters
$\bm{\theta}^T=[\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_{p-1}]$.

The input data can be organized in terms of a so-called design matrix 
with an approximating function $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ 
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}}= \bm{X}\bm{\theta},
\]
!et


!split
===== The objective/cost/loss function =====

The  simplest approach is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
or using the matrix $\bm{X}$ and in a more compact matrix-vector notation as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define the so-called cost function.


!split
===== Training solution  =====

Optimizing with respect to the unknown parameters $\theta_j$ we get 
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\theta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is invertible we have the optimal values
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} =\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

We say we 'learn' the unknown parameters $\bm{\theta}$ from the last equation.



!split
===== Ridge and LASSO Regression =====


Our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== From OLS to Ridge and Lasso =====

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\theta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\theta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. We do not include such a constraints in the discussions here.

!split
===== Lasso regression  =====

Defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\theta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et
we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 
Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et









!split
===== Examples: Many-body physics, Quantum Monte Carlo and deep learning =====
!bblock
Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.
!eblock


!split
===== Energy derivatives =====
!bblock
The local energy as function of the variational parameters defines now our _objective/cost_ function.

To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define (with the notation $\langle E[\bm{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle$)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha_i$
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
\]
!et  
!eblock


!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are 
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
\]
!et
These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its possible error sources). Use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal parameters.
!eblock


!split
===== Why Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN)?  =====

According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward
neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite
number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional
function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for
the hidden layer is a _non-constant, bounded and
monotonically-increasing continuous function_.

===== Generative models: Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.





!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
  o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\bm{x}$.
  o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\bm{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.


!split
===== Joint distribution =====
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution
!bt
\[
	P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})},
\]
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
!bt
\[
	Z = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\]
!et
Note the absence of the inverse temperature in these equations.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs (Energy based models) =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian binary =====


!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Representing the wave function =====

The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on
 $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of
 $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})}.
\]
!et

To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}) =\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} \exp{-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h})}.
\]
!et

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
!bt
\[
        \vert\Psi (\bm{X})\vert^2 = P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Define the cost function =====

Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

!bt
\[
	C_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\]

where the local energy is given by
!bt
\[
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\bm{H}} \Psi.

===== Extrapolations and model interpretability  =====

When you hear phrases like _predictions and estimations_ and
_correlations and causations_, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with
$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not
necessarily cause $A$.


!split
===== Physics based statistical learning and data analysis =====

The above concepts are in some sense the difference between _old-fashioned_ machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics and Bayesian machine learning.

===== Bayes' Theorem =====

Bayes' theorem
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
\]
!et


The quantity $p(Y\vert X)$ on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data $Y$ and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by $X$. This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.

The function $p(X)$ on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.

===== Mathematics of deep learning and neural networks =====

Throughout this course we will use the following notations. Vectors,
matrices and higher-order tensors are always boldfaced, with vectors
given by lower case letter letters and matrices and higher-order tensors given by upper case letters.

Unless otherwise stated, the elements $v_i$ of a vector $\bm{v}$ are assumed to be real. That is a vector of length $n$ is defined as
$\bm{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and if we have a complex vector we have $\bm{x}\in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.

For a matrix of dimension $n\times n$ we have 
$\bm{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and the first matrix element starts with row element (row-wise ordering) zero and column element zero.

===== Some  mathematical notations =====
o For all/any  $\forall$
o Implies $\implies$
o Equivalent $\equiv$
o Real variable $\mathbb{R}$
o Integer variable $\mathbb{I}$
o Complex  variable $\mathbb{C}$



!split
===== Vectors =====

We start by defining a vector $\bm{x}$  with $n$ components, with $x_0$ as our first element, as

!bt
\[
\bm{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0\\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
and its transpose 
!bt
\[
\bm{x}^{T} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & \dots & \dots & x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
In case we have a complex vector we define the hermitian conjugate
!bt
\[
\bm{x}^{\dagger} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0^* & x_1^* & x_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_{n-1}^* \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

With a given vector $\bm{x}$, we define the inner product as
!bt
\[
\bm{x}^T \bm{x} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_ix_i=x_0^2+x_1^2+\dots + x_{n-1}^2. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Outer products =====

In addition to inner products between vectors/states, the outer
product plays a central role in many applications. It is
defined as
!bt
\[
\bm{x}\bm{y}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
               x_0y_0 & x_0y_1 & x_0y_2 & \dots & \dots & x_0y_{n-2} & x_0y_{n-1} \\
	       x_1y_0 & x_1y_1 & x_1y_2 & \dots & \dots & x_1y_{n-2} & x_1y_{n-1} \\
	       x_2y_0 & x_2y_1 & x_2y_2 & \dots & \dots & x_2y_{n-2} & x_2y_{n-1} \\	       
               \dots &   \dots   & \dots  & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
               \dots &   \dots   & \dots  & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\	       
	       x_{n-2}y_0 & x_{n-2}y_1 & x_{n-2}y_2 & \dots & \dots & x_{n-2}y_{n-2} & x_{n-2}y_{n-1} \\
	       x_{n-1}y_0 & x_{n-1}y_1 & x_{n-1}y_2 & \dots & \dots & x_{n-1}y_{n-2} & x_{n-1}y_{n-1} \end{bmatrix}	       
\]
!et
The latter defines also our basic matrix layout.

               a_{n-10} & a_{n-11} & a_{n-12} & \dots & \dots & a_{n-1n-2} & a_{n-1n-1} \end{bmatrix},	       
\]
!et
or in terms of its column vectors $\bm{a}_i$ as
!bt
\[
 \bm{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}\bm{a}_{0} & \bm{a}_{1} & \bm{a}_{2} & \dots & \dots & \bm{a}_{n-2} & \bm{a}_{n-1}\end{bmatrix}.

===== Setting up the basic equations for neural networks =====

Neural networks, in its so-called feed-forward form, where each
iterations contains a feed-forward stage and a back-propgagation
stage, consist of series of affine matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications. The unknown parameters (the so-called biases and
weights which deternine the architecture of a neural network), are
uptaded iteratively using the so-called back-propagation algorithm.
This algorithm corresponds to the so-called reverse mode of the
automatic differentation algorithm. These algorithms will be discussed
in more detail below.

We start however first with the  definitions of the various variables which make up a neural network.

!split
===== Overarching view of a neural network =====

The architecture of a neural network defines our model. This model
aims at describing some function $f(\bm{x}$ which aims at describing
some final result (outputs or tagrget values) given a specific inpput
$\bm{x}$. Note that here $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{x}$ are not limited to be
vectors.

The architecture consists of
o An input and an output layer where the input layer is defined by the inputs $\bm{x}$. The output layer produces the model ouput $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ which is compared with the target value $\bm{y}$
o A given number of hidden layers and neurons/nodes/units for each layer (this may vary)
o A given activation function $\sigma(\bm{z})$ with arguments $\bm{z}$ to be defined below. The activation functions may differ from layer to layer.
o The last layer, normally called _output_ layer has normally an activation function tailored to the specific problem
o Finally we define a so-called cost or loss function which is used to gauge the quality of our model. 


!split
===== The optimzation problem =====

The cost function is a function of the unknown parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ where the latter is a container for all possible
parameters needed to define a neural network

If we are dealing with a regression task a typical cost/loss function
is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define
the so-called cost function.

For neural networks the parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ are given by the so-called weights and biases (to be
defined below).

The weights are given by matrix elements $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ where the
superscript indicates the layer number. The biases are typically given
by vector elements representing each single node of a given layer,
that is $b_j^{(l)}$.

!split
===== Other ingredients of a neural network =====

Having defined the architecture of a neural network, the optimization
of the cost function with respect to the parameters $\bm{\Theta}$,
involves the calculations of gradients and their optimization. The
gradients represent the derivatives of a multidimensional object and
are often approximated by various gradient methods, including
o various quasi-Newton methods,
o plain gradient descent (GD) with a constant learning rate $\eta$,
o GD with momentum and other approximations to the learning rates such as
  * Adapative gradient (ADAgrad)
  * Root mean-square propagation (RMSprop)
  * Adaptive gradient with momentum (ADAM) and many other
o Stochastic gradient descent and various families of learning rate approximations

!split
===== Other parameters =====

In addition to the above, there are often additional hyperparamaters
which are included in the setup of a neural network. These will be
discussed below.


!split
===== Setting up the equations for a neural network =====

The questions we want to ask are how do changes in the biases and the
weights in our network change the cost function and how can we use the
final output to modify the weights?

To derive these equations let us start with a plain regression problem
and define our cost function as

!bt
\[
{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta})  =  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \tilde{y}_i\right)^2, 
\]
!et

where the $y_i$s are our $n$ targets (the values we want to
reproduce), while the outputs of the network after having propagated
all inputs $\bm{x}$ are given by $\bm{\tilde{y}}_i$.

!split
===== Definitions =====

With our definition of the targets $\bm{y}$, the outputs of the
network $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ and the inputs $\bm{x}$ we
define now the activation $z_j^l$ of node/neuron/unit $j$ of the
$l$-th layer as a function of the bias, the weights which add up from
the previous layer $l-1$ and the forward passes/outputs
$\hat{a}^{l-1}$ from the previous layer as


!bt
\[
z_j^l = \sum_{i=1}^{M_{l-1}}w_{ij}^la_i^{l-1}+b_j^l,
\]
!et

where $b_k^l$ are the biases from layer $l$.  Here $M_{l-1}$
represents the total number of nodes/neurons/units of layer $l-1$. The
figure here illustrates this equation.  We can rewrite this in a more
compact form as the matrix-vector products we discussed earlier,

!bt
\[
\hat{z}^l = \left(\hat{W}^l\right)^T\hat{a}^{l-1}+\hat{b}^l.
\]
!et

!split
===== Inputs to tje activation function =====

With the activation values $\bm{z}^l$ we can in turn define the
output of layer $l$ as $\bm{a}^l = f(\bm{z}^l)$ where $f$ is our
activation function. In the examples here we will use the sigmoid
function discussed in our logistic regression lectures. We will also use the same activation function $f$ for all layers
and their nodes.  It means we have

!bt
\[
a_j^l = f(z_j^l) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{-(z_j^l)}}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Derivatives and the chain rule =====

From the definition of the activation $z_j^l$ we have
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l} = a_i^{l-1},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial a_i^{l-1}} = w_{ji}^l. 
\]
!et

With our definition of the activation function we have that (note that this function depends only on $z_j^l$)
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial a_j^l}{\partial z_j^{l}} = a_j^l(1-a_j^l)=f(z_j^l)(1-f(z_j^l)). 
\]
!et


!split
===== Derivative of the cost function =====

With these definitions we can now compute the derivative of the cost function in terms of the weights.

Let us specialize to the output layer $l=L$. Our cost function is
!bt
\[
{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta}^L)  =  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(a_i^L - y_i\right)^2, 
\]
!et
The derivative of this function with respect to the weights is

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta}^L)}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \left(a_j^L - y_j\right)\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}}, 
\]
!et
The last partial derivative can easily be computed and reads (by applying the chain rule)
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}} = \frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial z_{j}^{L}}\frac{\partial z_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}}=a_j^L(1-a_j^L)a_k^{L-1}.  
\]
!et



!split
===== Bringing it together, first back propagation equation =====

We have thus
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}((\bm{\Theta}^L)}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \left(a_j^L - y_j\right)a_j^L(1-a_j^L)a_k^{L-1}, 
\]
!et

Defining
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = a_j^L(1-a_j^L)\left(a_j^L - y_j\right) = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)},
\]
!et
and using the Hadamard product of two vectors we can write this as
!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}^L = f'(\hat{z}^L)\circ\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (\bm{a}^L)}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Analyzing the last results =====

This is an important expression. The second term on the right handside
measures how fast the cost function is changing as a function of the $j$th
output activation.  If, for example, the cost function doesn't depend
much on a particular output node $j$, then $\delta_j^L$ will be small,
which is what we would expect. The first term on the right, measures
how fast the activation function $f$ is changing at a given activation
value $z_j^L$.

!split
===== More considerations =====


Notice that everything in the above equations is easily computed.  In
particular, we compute $z_j^L$ while computing the behaviour of the
network, and it is only a small additional overhead to compute
$f'(z^L_j)$.  The exact form of the derivative with respect to the
output depends on the form of the cost function.
However, provided the cost function is known there should be little
trouble in calculating

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)}
\]
!et

With the definition of $\delta_j^L$ we have a more compact definition of the derivative of the cost function in terms of the weights, namely
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \delta_j^La_k^{L-1}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Derivatives in terms of $z_j^L$ =====

It is also easy to see that our previous equation can be written as

!bt
\[
\delta_j^L =\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_j^L}= \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial a_j^L}\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial z_j^L},
\]
!et
which can also be interpreted as the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the biases $b_j^L$, namely
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L}\frac{\partial b_j^L}{\partial z_j^L}=\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L},
\]
!et
That is, the error $\delta_j^L$ is exactly equal to the rate of change of the cost function as a function of the bias. 

!split
===== Bringing it together =====

We have now three equations that are essential for the computations of the derivatives of the cost function at the output layer. These equations are needed to start the algorithm and they are

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{\cal C}(\hat{W^L})}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \delta_j^La_k^{L-1},
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
\delta_j^L = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)},
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation}
\delta_j^L = \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L},
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Final back propagating equation =====

We have that (replacing $L$ with a general layer $l$)
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_j^l}.
\]
!et
We want to express this in terms of the equations for layer $l+1$.

!split
===== Using the chain rule and summing over all $k$ entries =====

We obtain
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\sum_k \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_k^{l+1}}\frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^{l}}=\sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}\frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^{l}},
\]
!et
and recalling that
!bt
\[
z_j^{l+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{M_{l}}w_{ij}^{l+1}a_i^{l}+b_j^{l+1},
\]
!et
with $M_l$ being the number of nodes in layer $l$, we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}w_{kj}^{l+1}f'(z_j^l),
\]
!et
This is our final equation.

We are now ready to set up the algorithm for back propagation and learning the weights and biases.

!split
===== Setting up the back propagation algorithm =====

The four equations  provide us with a way of computing the gradient of the cost function. Let us write this out in the form of an algorithm.

_First_, we set up the input data $\hat{x}$ and the activations
$\hat{z}_1$ of the input layer and compute the activation function and
the pertinent outputs $\hat{a}^1$.

_Secondly_, we perform then the feed forward till we reach the output
layer and compute all $\hat{z}_l$ of the input layer and compute the
activation function and the pertinent outputs $\hat{a}^l$ for
$l=2,3,\dots,L$.


!split
===== Setting up the back propagation algorithm, part 2 =====


Thereafter we compute the ouput error $\hat{\delta}^L$ by computing all
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)}.
\]
!et

Then we compute the back propagate error for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,2$ as
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l = \sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}w_{kj}^{l+1}f'(z_j^l).
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the Back propagation algorithm, part 3 =====


Finally, we update the weights and the biases using gradient descent
for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ and update the weights and biases
according to the rules

!bt
\[
w_{jk}^l\leftarrow  = w_{jk}^l- \eta \delta_j^la_k^{l-1},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
b_j^l \leftarrow b_j^l-\eta \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^l}=b_j^l-\eta \delta_j^l,
\]
!et
with $\eta$ being the learning rate.

===== Updating the gradients  =====

\]
!et
we update the weights and the biases using gradient descent for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ and update the weights and biases according to the rules
!bt
\[
w_{jk}^l\leftarrow  = w_{jk}^l- \eta \delta_j^la_k^{l-1},
\]
