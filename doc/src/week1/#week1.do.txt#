===== Practicalities and possible projects =====

o Although the course is defined as a self-study course, we can have weekly lectures with small weekly exercise assignments
o We plan to work on two projects which will define the content of the course, the format can be agreed upon by the participants but the following topics could define an outline for possible projects and machine learning topics
 * Deep learning with the aim to develop a code for CNNs and/or RNNs and study data of relevance for own research ("Higgs challenge for example":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/AdvancedMachineLearning/tree/main/doc/EarlierProjects/2022")
 * Study autoencoders and variational autoencoders with application to own data
 * GANs and applications to own data
 * Solve quantum/or classical many-body problems with deep learning methods (overlaps with FYS4411)
 * Physics informed Machine Learning, applications to for example solution of Navier-Stokes equations
 * Bayesian Machine Learning and Gaussian processes
 * and many other research paths and topics
o Final oral examination to be agreed upon
o All info at the GitHub address URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/AdvancedMachineLearning"

===== Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders =====

Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning
efficient representations of the input data (these representations are
called codings) without any supervision (i.e., the training set is
unlabeled). These codings typically have a much lower dimensionality
than the input data, making autoencoders useful for dimensionality
reduction.

More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and
they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.

===== GANs =====

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine
learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the
regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model
can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could
have been drawn from the original dataset.

_Generative models_ describe a class of statistical models that are a contrast
to _discriminative models_. Informally we say that generative models can
generate new data instances while discriminative models discriminate between
different kinds of data instances. A generative model could generate new photos
of animals that look like 'real' animals while a discriminative model could tell
a dog from a cat. More formally, given a data set $x$ and a set of labels /
targets $y$. Generative models capture the joint probability $p(x, y)$, or
just $p(x)$ if there are no labels, while discriminative models capture the
conditional probability $p(y | x)$. Discriminative models generally try to draw
boundaries in the data space (often high dimensional), while generative models
try to model how data is placed throughout the space.
