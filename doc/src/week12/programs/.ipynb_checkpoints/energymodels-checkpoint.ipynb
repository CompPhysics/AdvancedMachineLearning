    "In this tutorial, we will look at energy-based deep learning models, and focus on their application as generative models. Energy models have been a popular tool before the huge deep learning hype around 2012 hit. However, in recent years, energy-based models have gained increasing attention because of improved training methods and tricks being proposed. Although they are still in a research stage, they have shown to outperform strong Generative Adversarial Networks (Lecture/Tutorial 10) in certain cases which have been the state of the art of generating images ([blog post](https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/) about strong energy-based models, [blog post](https://medium.com/syncedreview/nvidia-open-sources-hyper-realistic-face-generator-stylegan-f346e1a73826) about the power of GANs). Hence, it is important to be aware of energy-based models, and as the theory can be abstract sometimes, we will show the idea of energy-based models with a lot of examples.\n",

    "## Energy Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this tutorial, we will review the theory of the energy-based models (the same theory has been discussed in Lecture 8). While most of the previous models had the goal of classification or regression, energy-based models are motivated from a different perspective: density estimation. Given a dataset with a lot of elements, we want to estimate the probability distribution over the whole data space. As an example, if we model images from CIFAR10, our goal would be to have a probability distribution over all possible images of size $32\\times32\\times3$ where those images have a high likelihood that look realistic and are one of the 10 CIFAR classes. Simple methods like interpolation between images don't work because images are extremely high-dimensional (especially for large HD images). Hence, we turn to deep learning methods that have performed well on complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, how do we predict a probability distribution $p(\\mathbf{x})$ over so many dimensions using a simple neural network? The problem is that we cannot just predict a score between 0 and 1, because a probability distribution over data needs to fulfill two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability distribution needs to assign any possible value of $\\mathbf{x}$ a non-negative value: $p(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0$.\n",
    "2. The probability density must sum/integrate to 1 over **all** possible inputs: $\\int_{\\mathbf{x}} p(\\mathbf{x}) d\\mathbf{x} = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there are actually many approaches for this, and one of them are energy-based models. The fundamental idea of energy-based models is that you can turn any function that predicts values larger than zero into a probability distribution by dividing by its volume. Imagine we have a neural network, which has as output a single neuron, like in regression. We can call this network $E_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\theta$ are our parameters of the network, and $\\mathbf{x}$ the input data (e.g. an image). The output of $E_{\\theta}$ is a scalar value between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$. Now, we can use basic probability theory to *normalize* the scores of all possible inputs:\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\exp$-function ensures that we assign a probability greater than zero to any possible input. We use a negative sign in front of $E$ because we call $E_{\\theta}$ to be the energy function: data points with high likelihood have a low energy, while data points with low likelihood have a high energy. $Z_{\\theta}$ is our normalization terms that ensures that the density integrates/sums to 1. We can show this by integrating over $q_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The main benefit of this formulation of the probability distribution is its great flexibility as we can choose $E_{\\theta}$ in whatever way we like, without any constraints. Nevertheless, when looking at the equation above, we can see a fundamental issue: How do we calculate $Z_{\\theta}$? There is no chance that we can calculate $Z_{\\theta}$ analytically for high-dimensional input and/or larger neural networks, but the task requires us to know $Z_{\\theta}$. Although we can't determine the exact likelihood of a point, there exist methods with which we can train energy-based models. Thus, we will look next at \"Contrastive Divergence\" for training the model."

As the exact likelihood of a point cannot be determined due to the unknown normalization constant $Z_{\\theta}$, we need to train energy-based models slightly different. We cannot just maximize the un-normalized probability $\\exp(-E_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{train}}))$ because there is no guarantee that $Z_{\\theta}$ stays constant, or that $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{train}}$ is becoming more likely than the others. However, if we base our training on comparing the likelihood of points, we can create a stable objective.

Although this objective sounds intuitive, how is it actually derived from our original distribution $q_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$? The trick is that we approximate $Z_{\\theta}$ by a single Monte-Carlo sample. This gives us the exact same objective as written above.\n",

    "For sampling from an energy-based model, we can apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo using Langevin Dynamics. The idea of the algorithm is to start from a random point, and slowly move towards the direction of higher probability using the gradients of $E_{\\theta}$. Nevertheless, this is not enough to fully capture the probability distribution. We need to add noise $\\omega$ at each gradient step to the current sample. Under certain conditions such as that we perform the gradient steps an infinite amount of times, we would be able to create an exact sample from our modeled distribution. However, as this is not practically possible, we usually limit the chain to $K$ steps ($K$ a hyperparameter that needs to be finetuned). Overall, the sampling procedure can be summarized in the following algorithm:\n",

A couple of examples are shown below (figure credit - [Stefano Ermon and Aditya Grover](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/assets/slides/cs236_lecture11.pdf)). A classification setup like object recognition or sequence labeling can be considered as an energy-based task as we just need to find the $Y$ input that minimizes the output $E(X, Y)$ (hence maximizes probability). Similarly, a popular application of energy-based models is denoising of images. Given an image $X$ with a lot of noise, we try to minimize the energy by finding the true input image $Y$. \n",

    "### Sampling buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part, we look at the training with sampled elements. To use the contrastive divergence objective, we need to generate samples during training. Previous work has shown that due to the high dimensionality of images, we need a lot of iterations inside the MCMC sampling to obtain reasonable samples. However, there is a training trick that significantly reduces the sampling cost: using a sampling buffer. The idea is that we store the samples of the last couple of batches in a buffer, and re-use those as the starting point of the MCMC algorithm for the next batches. This reduces the sampling cost because the model requires a significantly lower number of steps to converge to reasonable samples. However, to not solely rely on previous samples and allow novel samples as well, we re-initialize 5% of our samples from scratch (random noise between -1 and 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we implement the sampling buffer. The function `sample_new_exmps` returns a new batch of \"fake\" images. We refer to those as fake images because they have been generated, but are not actually part of the dataset. As mentioned before, we use initialize 5% randomly, and 95% are randomly picked from our buffer. On this initial batch, we perform MCMC for 60 iterations to improve the image quality and come closer to samples from $q_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$. In the function `generate_samples`, we implemented the MCMC for images. Note that the hyperparameters of `step_size`, `steps`, the noise standard deviation $\\sigma$ are specifically set for MNIST, and need to be finetuned for a different dataset if you want to use such."

    "The first few statements in each training iteration concern the sampling of the real and fake data, as we have seen above with the sample buffer. Next, we calculate the contrastive divergence objective using our energy model $E_{\\theta}$. However, one additional training trick we need is to add a regularization loss on the output of $E_{\\theta}$. As the output of the network is not constrained and adding a large bias or not to the output doesn't change the contrastive divergence loss, we need to ensure somehow else that the output values are in a reasonable range. Without the regularization loss, the output values will fluctuate in a very large range. With this, we ensure that the values for the real data are around 0, and the fake data likely slightly lower (for noise or outliers the score can be still significantly lower). As the regularization loss is less important than the Contrastive Divergence, we have a weight factor $\\alpha$ which is usually quite some smaller than 1. Finally, we perform an update step with an optimizer on the combined loss and add the new samples to the buffer.\n",

    "\n",
    "A very common and strong application of energy-based models is out-of-distribution detection (sometimes referred to as \"anomaly\" detection). As more and more deep learning models are applied in production and applications, a crucial aspect of these models is to know what the models don't know. Deep learning models are usually overconfident, meaning that they classify even random images sometimes with 100% probability. Clearly, this is not something that we want to see in applications. Energy-based models can help with this problem because they are trained to detect images that do not fit the training dataset distribution. Thus, in those applications, you could train an energy-based model along with the classifier, and only output predictions if the energy-based models assign a (unnormalized) probability higher than $\\delta$ to the image. You can actually combine classifiers and energy-based objectives in a single model, as proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03263).\n",

    "Finally, we should discuss the possible instabilities of energy-based models, in particular for the example of image generation that we have implemented in this notebook. In the process of hyperparameter search for this notebook, there have been several models that diverged. Divergence in energy-based models means that the models assign a high probability to examples of the training set which is a good thing. However, at the same time, the sampling algorithm fails and only generates noise images that obtain minimal probability scores. This happens because the model has created many local maxima in which the generated noise images fall. The energy surface over which we calculate the gradients to reach data points with high probability has \"diverged\" and is not useful for our MCMC sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides finding the optimal hyperparameters, a common trick in energy-based models is to reload stable checkpoints. If we detect that the model is diverging, we stop the training, load the model from one epoch ago where it did not diverge yet. Afterward, we continue training and hope that with a different seed the model is not diverging again. Nevertheless, this should be considered as the \"last hope\" for stabilizing the models, and careful hyperparameter tuning is the better way to do so. Sensitive hyperparameters include `step_size`, `steps` and the noise standard deviation in the sampler, and the learning rate and feature dimensionality in the CNN model. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have discussed energy-based models for generative modeling. The concept relies on the idea that any strictly positive function can be turned into a probability distribution by normalizing over the whole dataset. As this is not reasonable to calculate for high dimensional data like images, we train the model using contrastive divergence and sampling via MCMC. While the idea allows us to turn any neural network into an energy-based model, we have seen that there are multiple training tricks needed to stabilize the training. Furthermore, the training time of these models is relatively long as, during every training iteration, we need to sample new \"fake\" images, even with a sampling buffer. In the next lectures and assignment, we will see different generative models (e.g. VAE, GAN, NF) that allow us to do generative modeling more stably, but with the cost of more parameters."
