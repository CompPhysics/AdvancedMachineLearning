===== Essential elements of generative models =====

The aim of generative methods is to train a probability distribution $p$. The methods we will focus on are:
o Energy based models, with the family of Boltzmann distributions as a typical example
o Variational autoencoders, based on our discussions on autoencoders
o Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
o Diffusion models

!split
===== Energy models =====

Last week we defined a domain $\bm{X}$ of stochastic variables $\bm{X}= \{x_0,x_1, \dots , x_{n-1}\}$ with a pertinent probability distribution
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i),
\]
!et
where we have assumed that the random varaibles $x_i$ are all independent and identically distributed (iid).

We will now assume that we can defined this function in terms of optimization parameters $\bm{\Theta}$, which could be the biases and weights of deep network, and a set of hidden variables we also assume to be random variables which also are iid. The domain of these variables is
$\bm{H}= \{h_0,h_1, \dots , h_{m-1}\}$.

!split
===== Probability model =====

We define a probability
!bt
\[
p(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where $f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})$ is a function which we assume is larger or
equal than zero and obeys all properties required for a probability
distribution and $Z(\bm{\Theta})$ is a normalization constant. Inspired by
statistical mechanics, we call it often for the partition function.
It is defined as (assuming that we have discrete probability distributions)
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Marginal and conditional probabilities =====

We can in turn define the marginal probabilities
!bt
\[
p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
p(h_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Change of notation =====

_Note the change to a vector notation_. A variable like $\bm{x}$
represents now a specific _configuration_. We can generate an infinity
of such configurations. The final partition function is then the sum
over all such possible configurations, that is

!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
changes to
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{\bm{x}}\sum_{\bm{h}} f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et
If we have a binary set of variable $x_i$ and $h_j$ and $M$ values of $x_i$ and $N$ values of $h_j$ we have in total $2^M$ and $2^N$ possible $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ configurations, respectively.

We see that even for the modest binary case, we can easily approach a
number of configuration which is not possible to deal with.

!split
===== Optimization problem =====

At the end, we are not interested in the probabilities of the hidden variables. The probability we thus want to optimize is 
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i;\bm{\Theta})=\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\left(\frac{\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\right),
\]
!et
which we rewrite as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\left(\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})\right).
\]
!et

!split
===== Further simplifications =====

We simplify further by rewriting it as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})}\prod_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
where we used $p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}}f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta})$.
The optimization problem is then
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \mathrm{arg} \hspace{0.1cm}\max_{\bm{\bm{\Theta}}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}} \hspace{0.1cm}p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Optimizing the logarithm instead =====

Computing the derivatives with respect to the parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ is
easier (and equivalent) with taking the logarithm of the
probability. We will thus optimize
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \mathrm{arg} \hspace{0.1cm}\max_{\bm{\bm{\Theta}}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}} \hspace{0.1cm}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
which leads to
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})}=0.
\]
!et

!split
===== Expression for the gradients =====
This leads to the following equation
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{p(\bm{X};\bm{\Theta})}=\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\left(\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}\right)-\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=0.
\]
!et

The first term is called the positive phase and we assume that we have a model for the function $f$ from which we can sample values. Below we will develop an explicit model for this.
The second term is called the negative phase and is the one which leads to more difficulties.

!split
===== The derivative of the partition function =====

The partition function, defined above as
!bt
\[
Z(\bm{\Theta})=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} f(x_i,h_j;\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
is in general the most problematic term. In principle both $x$ and $h$ can span large degrees of freedom, if not even infinitely many ones, and computing the partition function itself is often not desirable or even feasible. The above derivative of the partition function can however be written in terms of an expectation value which is in turn evaluated  using Monte Carlo sampling and the theory of Markov chains, popularly shortened to MCMC (or just MC$^2$).

!split
===== Explicit expression for the derivative =====
We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}Z(\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
which reads in more detail
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}} \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et

We can rewrite the function $f$ (we have assumed that is larger or
equal than zero) as $f=\exp{\log{f}}$. We can then reqrite the last
equation as

!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{ \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}} \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\exp{\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}}   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Final expression =====

Taking the derivative gives us
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\frac{ \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}f(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}   }{Z(\bm{\Theta})}, 
\]
!et
which is the expectation value of $\log{f}$
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}}p(x_i;\bm{\Theta}) \nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
that is
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\bm{\Theta}}\log{Z(\bm{\Theta})}=\mathbb{E}(\log{f(x_i;\bm{\Theta})}).
\]
!et

This quantity is evaluated using Monte Carlo sampling, with Gibbs
sampling as the standard sampling rule.  Before we discuss the
explicit algorithms, we need to remind ourselves about Markov chains
and sampling rules like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Gibbs
sampling.

!split
===== Introducing the energy model =====

As we will see below, a typical Boltzmann machines employs a probability distribution
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where $f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ is given by a so-called energy model. If we assume that the random variables $x_i$ and $h_j$ take binary values only, for example $x_i,h_j=\{0,1\}$, we have a so-called binary-binary model where
!bt
\[
f(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})=-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X}} x_i a_i+\sum_{h_j\in \bm{H}} b_j h_j + \sum_{x_i\in \bm{X},h_j\in\bm{H}} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the set of parameters are given by the biases and weights $\bm{\Theta}=\{\bm{a},\bm{b},\bm{W}\}$.
_Note the vector notation_ instead of $x_i$ and $h_j$ for $f$. The vectors $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ represent a specific instance of stochastic variables $x_i$ and $h_j$. These arrangements of $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$ lead to a specific energy configuration.

!split
===== More compact notation =====

With the above definition we can write the probability as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{\exp{(\bm{a}^T\bm{x}+\bm{b}^T\bm{h}+\bm{x}^T\bm{W}\bm{h})}}{Z(\bm{\Theta})},
\]
!et
where the biases $\bm{a}$ and $\bm{h}$ and the weights defined by the matrix $\bm{W}$ are the parameters we need to optimize.

!split
===== Anticipating results to be derived =====

Since the binary-binary energy model is linear in the parameters $a_i$, $b_j$ and
$w_{ij}$, it is easy to see that the derivatives with respect to the
various optimization parameters yield expressions used in the
evaluation of gradients like
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial w_{ij}}=-x_ih_j,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial a_i}=-x_i,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial E(\bm{x}, \bm{h};\bm{\Theta})}{\partial b_j}=-h_j.
\]
!et

===== Reminder on Markov Chain Monte Carlo =====

* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.
* We start with a PDF $w(x_0,t_0)$  and we want to understand how the system evolves with time.
* We want to reach a situation where after a given number of time steps we obtain a steady state. This means that the system reaches its most likely state (equilibrium situation)
* Our PDF is normally a multidimensional object whose normalization constant is impossible to find.
* Analytical calculations from $w(x,t)$ are not possible.
* To sample directly from from $w(x,t)$ is not possible/difficult.
* The transition probability $W$ is also not  known.
* How can we establish that we have reached a steady state?   Sounds impossible!

_Use Markov chain Monte Carlo_

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes =====
A Markov process is a random walk with a selected probability for making a
move. The new move is independent of the previous history of the system.

The Markov process is used repeatedly in Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate
new random states.

The reason for choosing a Markov process is that when it is run for a
long enough time starting with a random state, we will eventually reach the most likely state of the system.

In thermodynamics, this means that after a certain number of Markov processes
we reach an equilibrium distribution.

This mimicks the way a real system reaches
its most likely state at a given temperature of the surroundings.

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, Ergodicity and Detailed balance =====

To reach this distribution, the Markov process needs to obey two important conditions, that of
_ergodicity_ and _detailed balance_. These conditions impose then constraints on our algorithms
for accepting or rejecting new random states.


The Metropolis algorithm discussed here
abides to both these constraints.

The Metropolis algorithm is widely used in Monte Carlo
simulations and the understanding of it rests within
the interpretation of random walks and Markov processes.

For a proof the ergodic theorem see URL:"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.17.2.656".

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, jargon =====

In a random walk one defines a mathematical entity called a _walker_, 
whose  attributes
completely define the state of the system in question. 

The state of the system  can refer to any physical quantities,
from the vibrational state of a molecule specified by a set of quantum numbers, 
to the brands of coffee in your favourite supermarket.


The walker moves in an appropriate state space by a combination of 
deterministic and random displacements from its previous
position.

This sequence of steps forms a _chain_.

!split 
===== Brownian motion and Markov processes, sequence of ingredients =====

* We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.
* Markov chains are intimately linked with the physical process of diffusion. 
* From a Markov chain we can then derive the conditions for detailed balance and ergodicity. These are the conditions needed for obtaining a steady state.
* The widely used algorithm for doing this is the so-called Metropolis algorithm, in its refined form the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
A Markov process allows in principle for a microscopic description of Brownian motion.
As with the random walk studied in the previous section, we consider a particle 
which moves along the  $x$-axis in the form of a series of jumps with step length 
$\Delta x = l$. Time and space are discretized and the subsequent moves are
statistically independent, i.e., the new move depends only on the previous step
and not on the results from earlier trials. 
We start at a position $x=jl=j\Delta x$ and move to 
a new position $x =i\Delta x$ during a step $\Delta t=\epsilon$, where 
$i\ge  0$ and $j\ge 0$ are integers. 
The original probability distribution function (PDF) of the particles is given by  
$p_i(t=0)$ where $i$ refers to a specific position on the grid in 
!eblock
The function $p_i(t=0)$ is now the discretized version of $p(x,t)$.
We can regard the discretized PDF as a vector.

!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
For the Markov process we have a transition probability from a position
$x=jl$ to a position $x=il$ given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   W_{ij}(\epsilon)=W(il-jl,\epsilon)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2} & |i-j| = 1\\
             0 & \mathrm{else} \end{array} \right. ,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $W_{ij}$ is normally called 
the transition probability and we can represent it, see below,
as a matrix. 
_Here we have specialized to a case where the transition probability is known_.

Our new PDF $p_i(t=\epsilon)$ is now related to the PDF at
$t=0$ through the relation

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   p_i(t=\epsilon) =\sum_{j} W(j\rightarrow i)p_j(t=0).
\end{equation*}
!et
 
This equation represents the discretized time-development of an original 
PDF with equal probability of jumping left or right.
!eblock

!split
===== Markov processes, the probabilities =====
!bblock

Since both $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{p}$ represent probabilities, they have to be normalized, i.e., we require
that at each time step we have

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   \sum_i p_i(t) = 1, 
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
   \sum_j W(j\rightarrow i) = 1,
\end{equation*}
!et
which applies for all $j$-values.
The further constraints are
$0 \le W_{ij} \le 1$  and  $0 \le p_{j} \le 1$.
Note that the probability for remaining at the same place is in general 
not necessarily equal zero. 
!eblock

!split
===== Markov processes =====
!bblock
The time development of our initial PDF can now be represented through the action of
the transition probability matrix applied $n$ times. At a 
time  $t_n=n\epsilon$ our initial distribution has developed into

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   p_i(t_n) = \sum_jW_{ij}(t_n)p_j(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
and defining

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   W(il-jl,n\epsilon)=(W^n(\epsilon))_{ij}
\end{equation*}
!et
we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   p_i(n\epsilon) = \sum_j(W^n(\epsilon))_{ij}p_j(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
or in matrix-vector form
!bt
\begin{equation} label{eq:wfinal}
   \bm{p}(n\epsilon) = \bm{W}^n(\epsilon)\bm{p}(0).
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock


!split
===== What do the results mean? =====


We have after $t$-steps

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \bm{p}(t) = \bm{W}^t\bm{p}(0),
\end{equation*}
!et
with $\bm{p}(0)$ the distribution at $t=0$ and $\bm{W}$ representing the 
transition probability matrix. 



!split
===== Understanding the basics =====


We can always expand $\bm{w}(0)$ in terms of the right eigenvectors 
$\bm{v}$ of $\bm{W}$ as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \bm{p}(0)  = \sum_i\alpha_i\bm{v}_i,
\end{equation*}
!et
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{p}(t) = \bm{W}^t\bm{p}(0)=\bm{W}^t\sum_i\alpha_i\bm{v}_i=
\sum_i\lambda_i^t\alpha_i\bm{v}_i,
\end{equation*}
!et
with $\lambda_i$ the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenvalue corresponding to  
the eigenvector $\bm{v}_i$. 

If we assume that $\lambda_0$ is the largest eigenvector we see that in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$,
$\bm{p}(t)$ becomes proportional to the corresponding eigenvector 
$\bm{v}_0$. This is our steady state or final distribution. 





!split
===== Basics of the Metropolis Algorithm =====


The Metropolis
algorithm is a method to sample a normalized probability
distribution by a stochastic process. We define $p_i^{(n)}$ to
be the probability for finding the system in the state $i$ at step $n$.

In the simulations, our assumption is that we have a model for $p_i^{(n)}$, but we do not know $W$.
We will hence model $W$ in terms of a likelihood for making transition $T$ and a likelihood for accepting a transition.
That is
!bt
\[
W_{i\rightarrow j}=A_{i\rightarrow j}T_{i\rightarrow j}
\]
!et

!split
=====  The basic of the Metropolis Algorithm =====



* Sample a possible new state $j$ with some probability $T_{i\rightarrow j}$.
* Accept the new state $j$ with probability $A_{i \rightarrow j}$ and use it as the next sample.
* With probability $1-A_{i\rightarrow j}$ the move is rejected and the original state $i$ is used again as a sample.


We wish to derive the required properties of $T$ and $A$ such that
$p_i^{(n\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow p_i$ so that starting
from any distribution, the method converges to the correct distribution.
Note that the description here is for a discrete probability distribution.
Replacing probabilities $p_i$ with expressions like $p(x_i)dx_i$ will
take all of these over to the corresponding continuum expressions.

!split
===== More on the Metropolis =====

The dynamical equation for $p_i^{(n)}$ can be written directly from
the description above. The probability of being in the state $i$ at step $n$
is given by the probability of being in any state $j$ at the previous step,
and making an accepted transition to $i$ added to the probability of
being in the state $i$, making a transition to any state $j$ and
rejecting the move:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq1}
p^{(n)}_i = \sum_j \left [
p^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
+p^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}\left ( 1- A_{i\rightarrow j} \right)
\right ] \,.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
=====  Metropolis algorithm, setting it up =====
Since the probability of making some transition must be 1,
$\sum_j T_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$, and Eq. (ref{eq:eq1}) becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
p^{(n)}_i = p^{(n-1)}_i +
 \sum_j \left [
p^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-p^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] \,.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Metropolis continues =====

For large $n$ we require that $p^{(n\rightarrow \infty)}_i = p_i$,
the desired probability distribution. Taking this limit, gives the
balance requirement

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_j \left [p_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}-p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] = 0,
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Detailed Balance =====

The balance requirement is very weak. Typically the much stronger detailed
balance requirement is enforced, that is rather than the sum being
set to zero, we set each term separately to zero and use this
to determine the acceptance probabilities. Rearranging, the result is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{ A_{j\rightarrow i}}{A_{i\rightarrow j}}
= \frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}} \,.
\end{equation}
!et

This is the "detailed balance requirement":"https://cims.nyu.edu/~holmes/teaching/asa19/handout_Lecture3_2019.pdf"

!split
===== More on Detailed Balance =====

The Metropolis choice is to maximize the $A$ values, that is

!bt
\begin{equation}
A_{j \rightarrow i} = \min \left ( 1,
\frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}}\right ).
\end{equation}
!et

Other choices are possible, but they all correspond to multiplying
$A_{i\rightarrow j}$ and $A_{j\rightarrow i}$ by the same constant
smaller than unity. The penalty function method uses just such
a factor to compensate for $p_i$ that are evaluated stochastically
and are therefore noisy.

Having chosen the acceptance probabilities, we have guaranteed that
if the  $p_i^{(n)}$ has equilibrated, that is if it is equal to $p_i$,
it will remain equilibrated.



!split
===== Gibbs sampling =====

An efficient way if performing the sampling is through the use of
Gibbs sampling. The latter uses the conditional probability instead of
the full probability as done in the Metropolis algorithm.

Gibbs sampling is useful for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions where single-variable conditional distributions are
known.

For example, say it is too expensive to sample from $p(x_0, x_1, x_2,
..., x_d)$. With Gibbs sampling, we initialize all variables to
arbitrary values. Then while taking each sample, we also iterate
through the dimensions and replace its value with a sample from the
univariate conditional distribution. For example we can update $x_1$
using $p(x_1 \mid x_0, x_2, ..., x_d)$, which is easy to sample over
because it is  only one dimension.


!split
===== Understanding Gibbs samoling =====

This part is best seen with the jupyter-notebook.
These notes have been adapted from URL:"https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2017/"

To illustrate Gibbs
sampling we will sample several points and compare them with those
generated from a known distribution, in our case the well-known
two-dimensional Gaussian defined as

!bt
\[
p(a, b) = \mathcal N\left(\left[\begin{array}{c} a \\ b \end{array}\right]; \left[\begin{array}{c}\mu_a \\ \mu_b\end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_a & cov(a, b) \\ cov(a, b) & \sigma_b\end{array}\right]\right) = \mathcal N\left(\left[\begin{array}{c}a \\ b\end{array}\right]; \left[\begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0\end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0.5 \\ 0.5 & 1\end{array}\right]\right).
\]
!et

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# two dimensions
D = 2

# set up the means (standard normal distribution
a_mu = 0
b_mu = 0
# and the variances and covariances
a_sigma = 1
b_sigma = 1
a_b_cov = 0.5

joint_cov = np.vstack(((a_sigma, a_b_cov), (a_b_cov, b_sigma)))
joint_mu = np.vstack((a_mu, b_mu))
!ec

Here we have used $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$ which allows us to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ by using $\sigma\epsilon + \mu$.
In the case of multivariate Gaussians, we use the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix
and then use it and the mean to adjust numbers generated using `np.random.randn`.

!bc pycod
N = 10000
L = np.linalg.cholesky(joint_cov)
samples_from_true_distribution =  L @ np.random.randn(D, N) + joint_mu
plt.plot(*samples_from_true_distribution, '.', alpha=0.1)
plt.axis([-4, 4, -4, 4])
plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== Conditional probabilities =====

Gibbs sampling requires conditional distributions for each variable. 

In the case of Gaussians, there is  a closed-form for the conditional. With a "multivariate Gaussian":"http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2017/notes/w7c_gaussian_processes.html" we have
!bt
\[
p(\textbf{f}, \textbf{g}) = 
\mathcal N\left(
\left[\begin{array}{c} \textbf{f} \\ \textbf{g} \end{array}\right];
\left[\begin{array}{c}\textbf{a} \\ \textbf{b}\end{array}\right], 
\left[\begin{array}{cc}A & C^{\top} \\ C & B\end{array}\right]
\right),
\]
!et
with the conditional probability

One thing to keep in mind about Gibbs sampling is that it only updates
one dimension at a time. This means that samples from around the same
time are correlated with each other. We have drawn the line connecting
sequential samples to show this.

Finally we sample a bunch of points and see how they compare to those
from the original distribution. It looks the same! What's cool is that
the one using Gibbs sampling only used samples from the univariate
conditionals!

===== Boltzmann Machines, marginal and conditional probabilities  =====

A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a
probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model
of the probability distribution from which the training data was
drawn. As an example
o A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.
o Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.
o Model the trial function for Monte Carlo calculations

!split
===== Generative and discriminative models =====

Generative and discriminative models use both gradient-descent based
learning procedures for minimizing cost functions

However, in energy based models we don't use backpropagation and automatic
differentiation for computing gradients, instead we turn to Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods.

A typical deep neural network has several hidden layers. A restricted
Boltzmann machine has normally one hidden layer, however several RBMs can
be stacked to make up deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute
the building blocks.

!split
===== Basics of the Boltzmann machine =====
!bblock
A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model
with stochastic continuous or discrete units.
!eblock
!bblock
It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the
state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected
to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the
interaction between various units/nodes.
!eblock

!split
===== More about the basics =====
!bblock
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\bm{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\bm{h}$.
!eblock

!bblock
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.
!eblock

!bblock
BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
!eblock

!split
===== Difficult to train =====

However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction
of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.  Here we take away all lateral
connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections
between nodes in the hidden layer.


!split
===== The network layers =====

o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".


!split
===== Goal of hidden layer =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

!split
===== The parameters =====

The network parameters, to be optimized/learned:
o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length $M$ as $\bm{x}$.
o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same length $N$  as $\bm{h}$.
o $\bm{W}$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.

Note that we have specified the lengths of $bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$. These
lengths define the number of visible and hidden units, respectively.

!split
===== Joint distribution =====

The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution
!bt
\begin{align*}
	P_{rbm}(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{1}{Z(\bm{\Theta})} \exp{-(E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}))},
\end{align*}
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function discussed earlier and defined as 
!bt
\begin{align*}
	Z(\bm{\Theta}) = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\end{align*}
!et
It is common to set  the temperature $T$ to one. It is omitted in the equations above. The energy is thus a dimensionless function.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h},\bm{\Theta})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\end{align*}
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian-binary RBM =====

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\end{align*}
!et

This type of RBMs are useful when we model continuous data (i.e., we wish $\bm{x}$ to be continuous). The paramater $\sigma_i^2$ is meant to represent a variance and is foten just set to one.


!split
===== Cost function =====

When working with a training dataset, the most common training
approach is maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data. The
log likelihood characterizes the log-probability of generating the
observed data using our generative model. Using this method our cost
function is chosen as the negative log-likelihood. The learning then
consists of trying to find parameters that maximize the probability of
the dataset, and is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

Denoting the parameters as $\bm{\Theta} = a_1,...,a_M,b_1,...,b_N,w_{11},...,w_{MN}$, the log-likelihood is given by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L}(\{ \Theta_i \}) &= \langle \text{log} P_\theta(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} \\
	&= - \langle E(\bm{x}; \{ \Theta_i\}) \rangle_{data} - \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\}),
\end{align*}
!et
where we used that the normalization constant does not depend on the data, $\langle \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\}) \rangle = \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})$
Our cost function is the negative log-likelihood, $\mathcal{C}(\{ \Theta_i \}) = - \mathcal{L}(\{ \Theta_i \})$

!split
===== Optimization / Training =====

The training procedure of choice often is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It consists of a series of iterations where we update the parameters according to the equation
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\bm{\Theta}_{k+1} = \bm{\Theta}_k - \eta \nabla \mathcal{C} (\bm{\Theta}_k)
\end{align*}
!et
at each $k$-th iteration. There are a range of variants of the algorithm which aim at making the learning rate $\eta$ more adaptive so the method might be more efficient while remaining stable.

!split
===== Gradients =====
We now need the gradient of the cost function in order to minimize it. We find that
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i}
	&= \langle \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i)}{\partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data}
	+ \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i} \\
	&= \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model}.
\end{align*}
!et
!split
===== Simplifications =====

In order to simplify notation we defined the "operator"
!bt
\begin{align*}
	O_i(\bm{x}) = \frac{\partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i)}{\partial \Theta_i}, 
\end{align*}
!et
and used the statistical mechanics relationship between expectation values and the log-partition function:
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model} = \text{Tr} P_\Theta(\bm{x})O_i(\bm{x}) = - \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \Theta_i\})}{\partial \Theta_i}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Positive and negative phases =====
As discussed earlier, the data-dependent term in the gradient is known as the positive phase
of the gradient, while the model-dependent term is known as the
negative phase of the gradient. The aim of the training is to lower
the energy of configurations that are near observed data points
(increasing their probability), and raising the energy of
configurations that are far from observed data points (decreasing
their probability).

!split
===== Gradient examples =====
The gradient of the negative log-likelihood cost function of a Binary-Binary RBM is then
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial w_{ij}} =& \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial a_{ij}} =& \langle x_i \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i \rangle_{model} \\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial b_{ij}} =& \langle h_i \rangle_{data} - \langle h_i \rangle_{model}. \\
\end{align*}
!et
To get the expectation values with respect to the *data*, we set the visible units to each of the observed samples in the training data, then update the hidden units according to the conditional probability found before. We then average over all samples in the training data to calculate expectation values with respect to the data. 



!split
===== Kullback-Leibler relative entropy =====

When the goal of the training is to approximate a probability
distribution, as it is in generative modeling, another relevant
measure is the _Kullback-Leibler divergence_, also known as the
relative entropy or Shannon entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the
dissimilarity between two probability density functions $p$ and
$q$. If $p$ is the unkown probability which we approximate with $q$,
we can measure the difference by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL}(p||q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p (\bm{x}) \log \frac{p(\bm{x})}{q(\bm{x})}  d\bm{x}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Kullback-Leibler divergence =====

Thus, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the
training data $f(\bm{x})$ and the model distribution $p(\bm{x}|
\bm{\Theta})$ is

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL} (f(\bm{x})|| p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})) =& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	f (\bm{x}) \log \frac{f(\bm{x})}{p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} \\
	=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log f(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log
	p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) d\bm{x} \\
	%=& \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log f(\bm{x})) - \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}))
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} - \langle \log p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \langle E(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \log Z \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \mathcal{C}_{LL} .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Maximizing log-likelihood =====

The first term is constant with respect to $\bm{\Theta}$ since
$f(\bm{x})$ is independent of $\bm{\Theta}$. Thus the Kullback-Leibler
Divergence is minimal when the second term is minimal. The second term
is the log-likelihood cost function, hence minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the
log-likelihood.


To further understand generative models it is useful to study the
gradient of the cost function which is needed in order to minimize it
using methods like stochastic gradient descent. 

!split
===== More on the partition function =====

The partition function is the generating function of
expectation values, in particular there are mathematical relationships
between expectation values and the log-partition function. In this
case we have
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{model}
	= \int p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta}) \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} d\bm{x} 
	= -\frac{\partial \log Z(\Theta_i)}{ \partial  \Theta_i} .
\end{align*}
!et

Here $\langle \cdot \rangle_{model}$ is the expectation value over the model probability distribution $p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})$.

!split
===== Setting up for gradient descent calculations =====

Using the previous relationship we can express the gradient of the cost function as

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}_{LL}}{\partial \Theta_i}
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data} + \frac{\partial \log Z(\Theta_i)}{ \partial  \Theta_i} \\
	=& \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{data} - \langle \frac{ \partial E(\bm{x}; \Theta_i) } { \partial \Theta_i} \rangle_{model} \\
	%=& \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\bm{x}) \rangle_{model}
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Difference of moments =====

This expression shows that the gradient of the log-likelihood cost
function is a _difference of moments_, with one calculated from
the data and one calculated from the model. The data-dependent term is
called the _positive phase_ and the model-dependent term is
called the _negative phase_ of the gradient. We see now that
minimizing the cost function results in lowering the energy of
configurations $\bm{x}$ near points in the training data and
increasing the energy of configurations not observed in the training
data. That means we increase the model's probability of configurations
similar to those in the training data.

!split
===== More observations =====

The gradient of the cost function also demonstrates why gradients of
unsupervised, generative models must be computed differently from for
those of for example FNNs. While the data-dependent expectation value
is easily calculated based on the samples $\bm{x}_i$ in the training
data, we must sample from the model in order to generate samples from
which to caclulate the model-dependent term. We sample from the model
by using MCMC-based methods. We can not sample from the model directly
because the partition function $Z$ is generally intractable.


!split
===== Adding hyperparameters =====

As in supervised machine learning problems, the goal is also here to
perform well on _unseen_ data, that is to have good
generalization from the training data. The distribution $f(x)$ we
approximate is not the _true_ distribution we wish to estimate,
it is limited to the training data. Hence, in unsupervised training as
well it is important to prevent overfitting to the training data. Thus
it is common to add regularizers to the cost function in the same
manner as we discussed for say linear regression.


!split
===== Mathematical details =====

Because we are restricted to potential functions which are positive it
is convenient to express them as exponentials.

The original RBM had binary visible and hidden nodes. They were
showned to be universal approximators of discrete distributions.
It was also shown that adding hidden units yields
strictly improved modelling power.


!split
===== Binary-binary (BB) RBMs =====

The common choice of binary values
are 0 and 1. However, in some physics applications, -1 and 1 might be
a more natural choice. We will here use 0 and 1. We habe the energy function

!bt
\begin{align*}
	E_{BB}(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j.
\end{align*}
!et


!split
===== Marginal probability =====

We have the binary-binary marginal probability defined as 
!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB}(\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) =& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\sum_i^M a_i x_i + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{ij}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j} \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}}
\end{align*}
!et

with the partition function

!bt
\begin{align*}
	Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{x}, \bm{h}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Marginal Probability Density Function for the visible units  =====

In order to find the probability of any configuration of the visible units we derive the marginal probability density function.

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{x},\bm{\Theta}) =& \sum_{\bm{h}} p_{BB} (\bm{x}, \bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} \sum_{\bm{h}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \sum_{\bm{h}} e^{\sum_j^N (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})h_j} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \sum_{\bm{h}} \prod_j^N e^{ (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})h_j} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \bigg ( \sum_{h_1} e^{(b_1 + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast 1})h_1}
	\times \sum_{h_2} e^{(b_2 + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast 2})h_2} \times \nonumber \\
	& ... \times \sum_{h_2} e^{(b_N + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast N})h_N} \bigg ) \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N \sum_{h_j} e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}) h_j} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}) .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Marginal probability for hidden units =====

A similar derivation yields the marginal probability of the hidden units

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{h},\bm{\Theta}) = \frac{1}{Z_{BB}(\bm{\Theta})} e^{\bm{b}^T \bm{h}} \prod_i^M (1 + e^{a_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}}) .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Conditional Probability Density Functions =====

We derive the probability of the hidden units given the visible units using Bayes' rule
(we drop the explicit $\bm{\Theta}$ dependence)
!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (\bm{h}|\bm{x}) =& \frac{p_{BB} (\bm{x}, \bm{h})}{p_{BB} (\bm{x})} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{ \frac{1}{Z_{BB}}  e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x} + \bm{b}^T \bm{h} + \bm{x}^T \bm{W} \bm{h}} }
	        {\frac{1}{Z_{BB}} e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}})} \nonumber \\
	=& \frac{  e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} e^{ \sum_j^N (b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j} }
	        { e^{\bm{a}^T \bm{x}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}})} \nonumber \\
	=& \prod_j^N \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \nonumber \\
	=& \prod_j^N p_{BB} (h_j| \bm{x}) .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== On and off probabilities =====

From this we find the probability of a hidden unit being "on" or "off":

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (h_j=1 | \bm{x}) =&   \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} ) h_j}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \\
	=&  \frac{ e^{(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j} )}  }
	{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}}} \\
	=&  \frac{ 1 }{1 + e^{-(b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j})} } ,
\end{align*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{align*}
	p_{BB} (h_j=0 | \bm{x}) =\frac{ 1 }{1 + e^{b_j + \bm{x}^T \bm{w}_{\ast j}} } .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Conditional probability for visible units =====

Similarly we have that the conditional probability of the visible units given the hidden are

===== Comments =====

The form of these conditional probabilities explains the name
"Gaussian" and the form of the Gaussian-binary energy function. We see
that the conditional probability of $x_i$ given $\bm{h}$ is a normal
distribution with mean $b_i + \bm{w}_{i\ast}^T \bm{h}$ and variance
$\sigma_i^2$.

===== Langevin sampling =====

Also called Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), is sampling
technique composed of characteristics from Stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) and Langevin dynamics, a mathematical extension of the Langevin
equation.  The SGLD is an iterative
optimization algorithm which uses minibatching to create a stochastic
gradient estimator, as used in SGD to optimize a differentiable
objective function.

Unlike traditional SGD, SGLD can be used for
Bayesian learning as a sampling method. SGLD may be viewed as Langevin
dynamics applied to posterior distributions, but the key difference is
that the likelihood gradient terms are minibatched, like in SGD. SGLD,
like Langevin dynamics, produces samples from a posterior distribution
of parameters based on available data.

!split
===== More on the SGLD =====

The SGLD uses the probability $p(\theta)$ (note that we limit
ourselves to just a variable $\theta$) and updates the _log_ of this
probability by initializing it through some random prior distribution,
normally just a uniform distribution which takes values between
$\theta\in [-1,1]$,

The update is given by
!bt
\[
\theta_{i+1}=\theta_{i}+\eta \nabla_{\theta} \log{p(\theta_{i})}+\sqrt{\eta}w_i,
\]
!et
where $w_i\sim N(0,1)$ are normally distributed with mean zero and
variance one and $i=0,1,\dots,k$, with $k$ the final number of
iterations.  The parameter $\eta$ is the learning rate. The term
$\sqrt{\eta}w_i$ introduces _noise_ in the equation.

!split
===== Code example of Langevin Sampling =====

In our calculations the gradient is calculated using the model we have
for the probability distribution. For an energy-based model this gives
us a derivative which involves the so-called positive and negative
phases discussed last week.

Read more about Langevin sampling at for example
URL:"https://www.lyndonduong.com/sgmcmc/". This site contains a nice
example of a PyTorch code which implements Langevin sampling.

===== Theory of Variational Autoencoders =====

Let us remind ourself about what an autoencoder is, see the jupyter-notebook at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/AdvancedMachineLearning/blob/main/doc/pub/week10/ipynb/week10.ipynb".


!split
===== The Autoencoder again =====


Autoencoders are neural networks where the outputs are its own
inputs. They are split into an _encoder part_
which maps the input $\bm{x}$ via a function $f(\bm{x},\bm{W})$ (this
is the encoder part) to a _so-called code part_ (or intermediate part)
with the result $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W})),
\]
!et
where $\bm{W}$ are the weights to be determined.  The _decoder_ parts maps, via its own parameters (weights given by the matrix $\bm{V}$ and its own biases) to 
the final ouput
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V})).
\]
!et

The goal is to minimize the construction error, often done by optimizing the means squared error.

!split
===== Schematic image of an Autoencoder =====

FIGURE: [figures/ae1.png, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Mathematics of Variational Autoencoders =====

We have defined earlier a probability (marginal) distribution with hidden variables $\bm{h}$ and parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \int d\bm{h}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for continuous variables $\bm{h}$ and
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{h}}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for discrete stochastic events $\bm{h}$. The variables $\bm{h}$ are normally called the _latent variables_ in the theory of autoencoders. We will also call then for that here.

!split
===== Using the conditional probability =====

Using the the definition of the conditional probabilities $p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$, $p(\bm{h}\vert\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ and 
and the prior $p(\bm{h})$, we can rewrite the above equation as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{h}}p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})p(\bm{h},
\]
!et

which allows us to make the dependence of $\bm{x}$ on $\bm{h}$
explicit by using the law of total probability. The intuition behind
this approach for finding the marginal probability for $\bm{x}$ is to
optimize the above equations with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$.  This is done normally by maximizing the probability,
the so-called maximum-likelihood approach discussed earlier.

!split
===== VAEs versus autoencoders =====

This trained probability is assumed to be able to produce similar
samples as the input.  In VAEs it is then common to compare via for
example the mean-squared error or the cross-entropy the predicted
values with the input values.  Compared with autoencoders, we are now
producing a probability instead of a functions which mimicks the
input.

In VAEs, the choice of this output distribution is often Gaussian,
meaning that the conditional probability is
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})=N(\bm{x}\vert f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}), \sigma^2\times \bm{I}),
\]
!et
with mean value given by the function $f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ and a
diagonal covariance matrix multiplied by a parameter $\sigma^2$ which
is treated as a hyperparameter.

!split
===== Gradient descent =====

By having a Gaussian distribution, we can use gradient descent (or any
other optimization technique) to increase $p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ by
making $f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ approach $\bm{x}$ for some $\bm{h}$,
gradually making the training data more likely under the generative
model. The important property is simply that the marginal probability
can be computed, and it is continuous in $\bm{\Theta}$..

!split
===== Are VAEs just modified autoencoders? =====

The mathematical basis of VAEs actually has relatively little to do
with classical autoencoders, for example the sparse autoencoders or
denoising autoencoders discussed earlier.

VAEs approximately maximize the probability equation discussed
above. They are called autoencoders only because the final training
objective that derives from this setup does have an encoder and a
decoder, and resembles a traditional autoencoder. Unlike sparse
autoencoders, there are generally no tuning parameters analogous to
the sparsity penalties. And unlike sparse and denoising autoencoders,
we can sample directly from $p(\bm{x})$ without performing Markov
Chain Monte Carlo.


!split
===== Training VAEs =====

To solve the integral or sum for $p(\bm{x})$, there are two problems
that VAEs must deal with: how to define the latent variables $\bm{h}$,
that is decide what information they represent, and how to deal with
the integral over $\bm{h}$.  VAEs give a definite answer to both.

===== Kullback-Leibler relative entropy (notation to be updated) =====

When the goal of the training is to approximate a probability
distribution, as it is in generative modeling, another relevant
measure is the _Kullback-Leibler divergence_, also known as the
relative entropy or Shannon entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the
dissimilarity between two probability density functions $p$ and
$q$. If $p$ is the unkown probability which we approximate with $q$,
we can measure the difference by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL}(p||q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p (\bm{x}) \log \frac{p(\bm{x})}{q(\bm{x})}  d\bm{x}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Kullback-Leibler divergence and RBMs =====

Thus, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the
training data $f(\bm{x})$ and the model marginal distribution $p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ from an RBM is

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL} (f(\bm{x})|| p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})) =& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	f (\bm{x}) \log \frac{f(\bm{x})}{p(\bm{x}; \bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} \\
	=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log f(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log
	p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) d\bm{x} \\
	%=& \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log f(\bm{x})) - \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log p(\bm{x}; \bm{\Theta}))
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} - \langle \log p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \langle E(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \log Z.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Maximizing log-likelihood =====

The first term is constant with respect to $\bm{\Theta}$ since
$f(\bm{x})$ is independent of $\bm{\Theta}$. Thus the Kullback-Leibler
divergence is minimal when the second term is minimal. The second term
is the log-likelihood cost function, hence minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the
log-likelihood. 


!split
===== Back to VAEs =====

We want to train the marginal probability with some latent variables $\bm{h}$
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \int d\bm{h}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for the continuous version (see previous slides for the discrete variant).


!split
===== Using the KL divergence =====

In practice, for most $\bm{h}$, $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h}; \bm{\Theta})$
will be nearly zero, and hence contribute almost nothing to our
estimate of $p(\bm{x})$.

The key idea behind the variational autoencoder is to attempt to
sample values of $\bm{h}$ that are likely to have produced $\bm{x}$,
and compute $p(\bm{x})$ just from those.

This means that we need a new function $Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$ which can
take a value of $\bm{x}$ and give us a distribution over $\bm{h}$
values that are likely to produce $\bm{x}$.  Hopefully the space of
$\bm{h}$ values that are likely under $Q$ will be much smaller than
the space of all $\bm{h}$'s that are likely under the prior
$p(\bm{h})$.  This lets us, for example, compute $E_{\bm{h}\sim
Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ relatively easily. Note that we drop
$\bm{\Theta}$ from here and for notational simplicity.


!split
===== Kullback-Leibler again =====

However, if $\bm{h}$ is sampled from an arbitrary distribution with
PDF $Q(\bm{h})$, which is not $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, then how does that
help us optimize $p(\bm{x})$?

The first thing we need to do is relate
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}P(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$.  We will see where $Q$ comes from later.

The relationship between $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$ is one of the cornerstones of variational Bayesian methods.
We begin with the definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence or $\mathcal{D}$) between $p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})$ and $Q(\bm{h})$, for some arbitrary $Q$ (which may or may not depend on $\bm{x}$):
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}|\bm{x}) \right].
\]
!et

!split
===== And applying Bayes rule =====

We can get both $p(\bm{x})$ and $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ into this equation by applying Bayes rule to $p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}) \right] + \log p(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

Here, $\log p(\bm{x})$ comes out of the expectation because it does not depend on $\bm{h}$.
Negating both sides, rearranging, and contracting part of $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}$ into a KL-divergence terms yields:
!bt
\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|P(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Rearranging =====

Using Bayes rule we obtain
!bt
\[
E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{h}|y_i,x_i) - \log p(\bm{h}|x_i) + \log p(y_i|x_i) \right]
\]
!et

Rearranging the terms and subtracting $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\log Q(\bm{h})$ from both sides gives
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\log P(y_i|x_i) - E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h})-\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)\right]=\hspace{10em}\\
\hspace{10em}E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)+\log p(\bm{h}|x_i)-\log Q(\bm{h})\right]
\end{array}
\]
!et
Note that $\bm{x}$ is fixed, and $Q$ can be \textit{any} distribution, not
just a distribution which does a good job mapping $\bm{x}$ to the $\bm{h}$'s
that can produce $X$.


!split
===== Inferring the probability =====

Since we are interested in inferring $p(\bm{x})$, it makes sense to
construct a $Q$ which \textit{does} depend on $\bm{x}$, and in particular,
one which makes $\mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]$ small
!bt
\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

Hence, during training, it makes sense to choose a $Q$ which will make
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}[\log Q(\bm{h})-$ $\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)]$ (a
$\mathcal{D}$-divergence) small, such that the right hand side is a
close approximation to $\log p(y_i|y_i)$.

!split
===== Central equation of VAEs =====

This equation serves as the core of the variational autoencoder, and
it is worth spending some time thinking about what it means.

o The left hand side has the quantity we want to maximize, namely $\log p(\bm{x})$ plus an error term.
o The right hand side is something we can optimize via stochastic gradient descent given the right choice of $Q$.


!split
===== Setting up SGD =====
So how can we perform stochastic gradient descent?

First we need to be a bit more specific about the form that $Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$
will take.  The usual choice is to say that
$Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})=\mathcal{N}(\bm{h}|\mu(\bm{x};\vartheta),\Sigma(;\vartheta))$, where
$\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are arbitrary deterministic functions with
parameters $\vartheta$ that can be learned from data (we will omit
$\vartheta$ in later equations).  In practice, $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are
again implemented via neural networks, and $\Sigma$ is constrained to
be a diagonal matrix.


!split
===== More on the SGD =====

The name variational ``autoencoder'' comes from
the fact that $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are ``encoding'' $\bm{x}$ into the latent
space $\bm{h}$.  The advantages of this choice are computational, as they
make it clear how to compute the right hand side.  The last
term---$\mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h})\right]$---is now a KL-divergence
between two multivariate Gaussian distributions, which can be computed
in closed form as:
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
 \mathcal{D}[\mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\Sigma_0) \| \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\Sigma_1)] = \hspace{20em}\\
  \hspace{5em}\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \left( \mathrm{tr} \left( \Sigma_1^{-1} \Sigma_0 \right) + \left( \mu_1 - \mu_0\right)^\top \Sigma_1^{-1} ( \mu_1 - \mu_0 ) - k + \log \left( \frac{ \det \Sigma_1 }{ \det \Sigma_0  } \right)  \right)
\end{array}
\]
!et
where $k$ is the dimensionality of the distribution.

!split
===== Simplification =====
In our case, this simplifies to:
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
 \mathcal{D}[\mathcal{N}(\mu(X),\Sigma(X)) \| \mathcal{N}(0,I)] = \hspace{20em}\\
\hspace{6em}\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \left( \mathrm{tr} \left( \Sigma(X) \right) + \left( \mu(X)\right)^\top ( \mu(X) ) - k - \log\det\left(  \Sigma(X)  \right)  \right).
\end{array}
\]
!et


!split
===== Terms to compute =====

The first term on the right hand side is a bit more tricky.
We could use sampling to estimate $E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$, but getting a good estimate would require passing many samples of $z$ through $f$, which would be expensive.
Hence, as is standard in stochastic gradient descent, we take one sample of $z$ and treat $\log P(X|z)$ for that $z$ as an approximation of $E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$.
After all, we are already doing stochastic gradient descent over different values of $X$ sampled from a dataset $D$.
The full equation we want to optimize is:

!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
    E_{X\sim D}\left[\log P(X) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z|X)\right]\right]=\hspace{16em}\\
\hspace{10em}E_{X\sim D}\left[E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right]\right].
\end{array}
\]
!et


!split
===== Computing the gradients =====

If we take the gradient of this equation, the gradient symbol can be moved into the expectations.
Therefore, we can sample a single value of $X$ and a single value of $z$ from the distribution $Q(z|X)$, and compute the gradient of:
!bt
\begin{equation}
 \log P(X|z)-\mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right].
\end{equation}
!et

We can then average the gradient of this function over arbitrarily many samples of $X$ and $z$, and the result converges to the gradient.

There is, however, a significant problem
$E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$ depends not just on the parameters of $P$, but also on the parameters of $Q$.

In order to make VAEs work, it is essential to drive $Q$ to produce codes for $X$ that $P$ can reliably decode.  
!bt
\[
 E_{X\sim D}\left[E_{\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)}[\log P(X|z=\mu(X)+\Sigma^{1/2}(X)*\epsilon)]-\mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right]\right].
\]

===== Motivation from Kingma and Welling, An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders, URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02691" =====


*There are many reasons why generative modeling is attractive. First,
we can express physical laws and constraints into the generative
process while details that we don’t know or care about, i.e. nuisance
variables, are treated as noise. The resulting models are usually
highly intuitive and interpretable and by testing them against
observations we can confirm or reject our theories about how the world
works.  Another reason for trying to understand the generative process
of data is that it naturally expresses causal relations of the
world. Causal relations have the great advantage that they generalize
much better to new situations than mere correlations. For instance,
once we understand the generative process of an earthquake, we can use
that knowledge both in California and in Chile.*


!split
===== Mathematics of  VAEs =====

We want to train the marginal probability with some latent varrables $\bm{h}$
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \int d\bm{h}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for the continuous version (see previous slides for the discrete variant).


!split
===== Using the KL divergence =====

In practice, for most $\bm{h}$, $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h}; \bm{\Theta})$
will be nearly zero, and hence contributes almost nothing to our
estimate of $p(\bm{x})$.

The key idea behind the variational autoencoder is to attempt to
sample values of $\bm{h}$ that are likely to have produced $\bm{x}$,
and compute $p(\bm{x})$ just from those.

This means that we need a new function $Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$ which can
take a value of $\bm{x}$ and give us a distribution over $\bm{h}$
values that are likely to produce $\bm{x}$.  Hopefully the space of
$\bm{h}$ values that are likely under $Q$ will be much smaller than
the space of all $\bm{h}$'s that are likely under the prior
$p(\bm{h})$.  This lets us, for example, compute $E_{\bm{h}\sim
Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ relatively easily. Note that we drop
$\bm{\Theta}$ from here and for notational simplicity.


!split
===== Kullback-Leibler again =====

However, if $\bm{h}$ is sampled from an arbitrary distribution with
PDF $Q(\bm{h})$, which is not $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, then how does that
help us optimize $p(\bm{x})$?

The first thing we need to do is relate
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}P(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$.  We will see where $Q$ comes from later.

The relationship between $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$ is one of the cornerstones of variational Bayesian methods.
We begin with the definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence or $\mathcal{D}$) between $p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})$ and $Q(\bm{h})$, for some arbitrary $Q$ (which may or may not depend on $\bm{x}$):
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}|\bm{x}) \right].
\]
!et

!split
===== And applying Bayes rule =====

We can get both $p(\bm{x})$ and $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ into this equation by applying Bayes rule to $p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}) \right] + \log p(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

Here, $\log p(\bm{x})$ comes out of the expectation because it does not depend on $\bm{h}$.
Negating both sides, rearranging, and contracting part of $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}$ into a KL-divergence terms yields:
!bt
\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|P(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Rearranging =====

Using Bayes rule we obtain
!bt
\[
E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{h}|y_i,x_i) - \log p(\bm{h}|x_i) + \log p(y_i|x_i) \right]
\]
!et

Rearranging the terms and subtracting $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\log Q(\bm{h})$ from both sides gives
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\log P(y_i|x_i) - E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h})-\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)\right]=\hspace{10em}\\
\hspace{10em}E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)+\log p(\bm{h}|x_i)-\log Q(\bm{h})\right]
\end{array}
\]
!et
Note that $\bm{x}$ is fixed, and $Q$ can be \textit{any} distribution, not
just a distribution which does a good job mapping $\bm{x}$ to the $\bm{h}$'s
that can produce $X$.

===== Inferring the probability =====

construct a $Q$ which \textit{does} depend on $\bm{x}$, and in particular,
one which makes $\mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]$ small

\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

Hence, during training, it makes sense to choose a $Q$ which will make
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}[\log Q(\bm{h})-$ $\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)]$ (a
$\mathcal{D}$-divergence) small, such that the right hand side is a
close approximation to $\log p(y_i|y_i)$.
