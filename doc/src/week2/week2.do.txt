===== Mathematics of deep learning and neural networks =====


Neural networks, in its so-called feed-forward form, where each
iterations contains a feed-forward stage and a back-propgagation
stage, consist of series of affine matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications. The unknown parameters (the so-called biases and
weights which deternine the architecture of a neural network), are
uptaded iteratively using the so-called back-propagation algorithm.
This algorithm corresponds to the so-called reverse mode of 
automatic differentation. 

!split
===== Basics of an NN =====

A neural network consists of a series of hidden layers, in addition to
the input and output layers.  Each layer $l$ has a set of parameters
$\bm{\Theta}^{(l)}=(\bm{W}^{(l)},\bm{b}^{(l)})$ which are related to the
parameters in other layers through a series of affine transformations,
for a standard NN these are matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications.  For all layers we will simply use a collective variable $\bm{\Theta}$.

It consist of two basic steps:
o a feed forward stage which takes a given input and produces a final output which is compared with the target values through our cost/loss function.
o a back-propagation state where the unknown parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ are updated through the optimization of the their gradients. The expressions for the gradients are obtained via the chain rule, starting from the derivative of the cost/function.

These two steps make up one iteration. This iterative process is continued till we reach an eventual stopping criterion.


!split
===== Overarching view of a neural network =====

The architecture of a neural network defines our model. This model
aims at describing some function $f(\bm{x}$ that is meant to describe
some final result (outputs or target values $bm{y}$) given a specific input
$\bm{x}$. Note that here $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{x}$ are not limited to be
vectors.

The architecture consists of
o An input and an output layer where the input layer is defined by the inputs $\bm{x}$. The output layer produces the model ouput $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ which is compared with the target value $\bm{y}$
o A given number of hidden layers and neurons/nodes/units for each layer (this may vary)
o A given activation function $\sigma(\bm{z})$ with arguments $\bm{z}$ to be defined below. The activation functions may differ from layer to layer.
o The last layer, normally called _output_ layer has an activation function tailored to the specific problem
o Finally, we define a so-called cost or loss function which is used to gauge the quality of our model. 


!split
===== The optimization problem =====

The cost function is a function of the unknown parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ where the latter is a container for all possible
parameters needed to define a neural network

If we are dealing with a regression task a typical cost/loss function
is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define
the so-called cost function. Note that here we have assumed a linear dependence in terms of the paramters $\bm{\Theta}$. This is in general not the case.


!split
===== Parameters of neural networks =====
For neural networks the parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$ are given by the so-called weights and biases (to be
defined below).

The weights are given by matrix elements $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ where the
superscript indicates the layer number. The biases are typically given
by vector elements representing each single node of a given layer,
that is $b_j^{(l)}$.

!split
===== Other ingredients of a neural network =====

Having defined the architecture of a neural network, the optimization
of the cost function with respect to the parameters $\bm{\Theta}$,
involves the calculations of gradients and their optimization. The
gradients represent the derivatives of a multidimensional object and
are often approximated by various gradient methods, including
o various quasi-Newton methods,
o plain gradient descent (GD) with a constant learning rate $\eta$,
o GD with momentum and other approximations to the learning rates such as
  * Adapative gradient (ADAgrad)
  * Root mean-square propagation (RMSprop)
  * Adaptive gradient with momentum (ADAM) and many other
o Stochastic gradient descent and various families of learning rate approximations

!split
===== Other parameters =====

In addition to the above, there are often additional hyperparamaters
which are included in the setup of a neural network. These will be
discussed below.


!split
===== Universal approximation theorem =====

The universal approximation theorem plays a central role in deep
learning.  "Cybenko (1989)":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02551274" showed
the following:

!bblock
Let $\sigma$ be any continuous sigmoidal function such that
!bt
\[
\sigma(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & z\rightarrow \infty\\ 0 & z \rightarrow -\infty \end{array}\right.
\]
!et
Given a continuous and deterministic function $F(\bm{x})$ on the unit
cube in $d$-dimensions $F\in [0,1]^d$, $x\in [0,1]^d$ and a parameter
$\epsilon >0$, there is a one-layer (hidden) neural network
$f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ with $\bm{\Theta}=(\bm{W},\bm{b})$ and $\bm{W}\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\bm{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, for which
!bt
\[
\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert < \epsilon \hspace{0.1cm} \forall \bm{x}\in[0,1]^d.
\]
!et

!eblock

!split
===== Some parallels from real analysis =====

For those of you familiar with for example the "Stone-Weierstrass
theorem":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem"
for polynomial approximations or the convergence criterion for Fourier
series, there are similarities in the derivation of the proof for
neural networks. 

!split
===== The approximation theorem in words =====

_Any continuous function $y=F(\bm{x})$ supported on the unit cube in
$d$-dimensions can be approximated by a one-layer sigmoidal network to
arbitrary accuracy._

"Hornik (1991)":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089360809190009T" extended the theorem by letting any non-constant, bounded activation function to be included using that the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \infty.
\]
!et
Then we have
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \epsilon.
\]
!et


!split
===== More on the general approximation theorem =====

None of the proofs give any insight into the relation between the
number of of hidden layers and nodes and the approximation error
$\epsilon$, nor the magnitudes of $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{b}$.

Neural networks (NNs) have what we may call a kind of universality no matter what function we want to compute.

!bblock
It does not mean that an NN can be used to exactly compute any function. Rather, we get an approximation that is as good as we want. 
!eblock

!split
===== Class of functions we can approximate =====

!bblock
The class of functions that can be approximated are the continuous ones.
If the function $F(\bm{x})$ is discontinuous, it won't in general be possible to approximate it. However, an NN may still give an approximation even if we fail in some points.
!eblock



!split
===== Setting up the equations for a neural network =====

The questions we want to ask are how do changes in the biases and the
weights in our network change the cost function and how can we use the
final output to modify the weights and biases?

To derive these equations let us start with a plain regression problem
and define our cost function as

!bt
\[
{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta})  =  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \tilde{y}_i\right)^2, 
\]
!et

where the $y_i$s are our $n$ targets (the values we want to
reproduce), while the outputs of the network after having propagated
all inputs $\bm{x}$ are given by $\bm{\tilde{y}}_i$.


!split
===== Layout of a neural network with three hidden layers =====

FIGURE: [figures/nn1.pdf, width=900 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Definitions =====

With our definition of the targets $\bm{y}$, the outputs of the
network $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ and the inputs $\bm{x}$ we
define now the activation $z_j^l$ of node/neuron/unit $j$ of the
$l$-th layer as a function of the bias, the weights which add up from
the previous layer $l-1$ and the forward passes/outputs
$\hat{a}^{l-1}$ from the previous layer as


!bt
\[
z_j^l = \sum_{i=1}^{M_{l-1}}w_{ij}^la_i^{l-1}+b_j^l,
\]
!et

where $b_k^l$ are the biases from layer $l$.  Here $M_{l-1}$
represents the total number of nodes/neurons/units of layer $l-1$. The
figure in the whiteboard notes illustrates this equation.  We can rewrite this in a more
compact form as the matrix-vector products we discussed earlier,

!bt
\[
\hat{z}^l = \left(\hat{W}^l\right)^T\hat{a}^{l-1}+\hat{b}^l.
\]
!et

!split
===== Inputs to the activation function =====

With the activation values $\bm{z}^l$ we can in turn define the
output of layer $l$ as $\bm{a}^l = f(\bm{z}^l)$ where $f$ is our
activation function. In the examples here we will use the sigmoid
function discussed in our logistic regression lectures. We will also use the same activation function $f$ for all layers
and their nodes.  It means we have

!bt
\[
a_j^l = f(z_j^l) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{-(z_j^l)}}.
\]
!et




!split
===== Derivatives and the chain rule =====

From the definition of the activation $z_j^l$ we have
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l} = a_i^{l-1},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial a_i^{l-1}} = w_{ji}^l. 
\]
!et

With our definition of the activation function we have that (note that this function depends only on $z_j^l$)
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial a_j^l}{\partial z_j^{l}} = a_j^l(1-a_j^l)=f(z_j^l)(1-f(z_j^l)). 
\]
!et


!split
===== Derivative of the cost function =====

With these definitions we can now compute the derivative of the cost function in terms of the weights.

Let us specialize to the output layer $l=L$. Our cost function is
!bt
\[
{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta}^L)  =  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(a_i^L - y_i\right)^2, 
\]
!et
The derivative of this function with respect to the weights is

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}(\bm{\Theta}^L)}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \left(a_j^L - y_j\right)\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}}, 
\]
!et
The last partial derivative can easily be computed and reads (by applying the chain rule)
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}} = \frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial z_{j}^{L}}\frac{\partial z_j^L}{\partial w_{jk}^{L}}=a_j^L(1-a_j^L)a_k^{L-1}.  
\]
!et



!split
===== Bringing it together, first back propagation equation =====

We have thus
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}((\bm{\Theta}^L)}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \left(a_j^L - y_j\right)a_j^L(1-a_j^L)a_k^{L-1}, 
\]
!et

Defining
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = a_j^L(1-a_j^L)\left(a_j^L - y_j\right) = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)},
\]
!et
and using the Hadamard product of two vectors we can write this as
!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}^L = f'(\hat{z}^L)\circ\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (\bm{a}^L)}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Analyzing the last results =====

This is an important expression. The second term on the right handside
measures how fast the cost function is changing as a function of the $j$th
output activation.  If, for example, the cost function doesn't depend
much on a particular output node $j$, then $\delta_j^L$ will be small,
which is what we would expect. The first term on the right, measures
how fast the activation function $f$ is changing at a given activation
value $z_j^L$.

!split
===== More considerations =====


Notice that everything in the above equations is easily computed.  In
particular, we compute $z_j^L$ while computing the behaviour of the
network, and it is only a small additional overhead to compute
$f'(z^L_j)$.  The exact form of the derivative with respect to the
output depends on the form of the cost function.
However, provided the cost function is known there should be little
trouble in calculating

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)}
\]
!et

With the definition of $\delta_j^L$ we have a more compact definition of the derivative of the cost function in terms of the weights, namely
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial{\cal C}}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \delta_j^La_k^{L-1}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Derivatives in terms of $z_j^L$ =====

It is also easy to see that our previous equation can be written as

!bt
\[
\delta_j^L =\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_j^L}= \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial a_j^L}\frac{\partial a_j^L}{\partial z_j^L},
\]
!et
which can also be interpreted as the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the biases $b_j^L$, namely
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L}\frac{\partial b_j^L}{\partial z_j^L}=\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L},
\]
!et
That is, the error $\delta_j^L$ is exactly equal to the rate of change of the cost function as a function of the bias. 

!split
===== Bringing it together =====

We have now three equations that are essential for the computations of the derivatives of the cost function at the output layer. These equations are needed to start the algorithm and they are

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{\cal C}(\hat{W^L})}{\partial w_{jk}^L}  =  \delta_j^La_k^{L-1},
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
\delta_j^L = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)},
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation}
\delta_j^L = \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^L},
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Final back propagating equation =====

We have that (replacing $L$ with a general layer $l$)
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_j^l}.
\]
!et
We want to express this in terms of the equations for layer $l+1$.

!split
===== Using the chain rule and summing over all $k$ entries =====

We obtain
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\sum_k \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial z_k^{l+1}}\frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^{l}}=\sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}\frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^{l}},
\]
!et
and recalling that
!bt
\[
z_j^{l+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{M_{l}}w_{ij}^{l+1}a_i^{l}+b_j^{l+1},
\]
!et
with $M_l$ being the number of nodes in layer $l$, we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l =\sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}w_{kj}^{l+1}f'(z_j^l),
\]
!et
This is our final equation.

We are now ready to set up the algorithm for back propagation and learning the weights and biases.

!split
===== Setting up the back propagation algorithm =====

The four equations  provide us with a way of computing the gradient of the cost function. Let us write this out in the form of an algorithm.

_First_, we set up the input data $\hat{x}$ and the activations
$\hat{z}_1$ of the input layer and compute the activation function and
the pertinent outputs $\hat{a}^1$.

_Secondly_, we perform then the feed forward till we reach the output
layer and compute all $\hat{z}_l$ of the input layer and compute the
activation function and the pertinent outputs $\hat{a}^l$ for
$l=1,2,3,\dots,L$.


_Notation_: The first hidden layer has $l=1$ as label and the final output layer has $l=L$.

!split
===== Setting up the back propagation algorithm, part 2 =====


Thereafter we compute the ouput error $\hat{\delta}^L$ by computing all
!bt
\[
\delta_j^L = f'(z_j^L)\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial (a_j^L)}.
\]
!et

Then we compute the back propagate error for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ as
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l = \sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}w_{kj}^{l+1}f'(z_j^l).
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the Back propagation algorithm, part 3 =====


Finally, we update the weights and the biases using gradient descent
for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ and update the weights and biases
according to the rules

!bt
\[
w_{jk}^l\leftarrow  = w_{jk}^l- \eta \delta_j^la_k^{l-1},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
b_j^l \leftarrow b_j^l-\eta \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^l}=b_j^l-\eta \delta_j^l,
\]
!et
with $\eta$ being the learning rate.

!split
===== Updating the gradients  =====

With the back propagate error for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ as
!bt
\[
\delta_j^l = \sum_k \delta_k^{l+1}w_{kj}^{l+1}f'(z_j^l),
\]
!et
we update the weights and the biases using gradient descent for each $l=L-1,L-2,\dots,1$ and update the weights and biases according to the rules
!bt
\[
w_{jk}^l\leftarrow  = w_{jk}^l- \eta \delta_j^la_k^{l-1},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
b_j^l \leftarrow b_j^l-\eta \frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial b_j^l}=b_j^l-\eta \delta_j^l,
\]
!et


!split
===== Fine-tuning neural network hyperparameters =====

The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main
drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you
use any imaginable network topology (how neurons/nodes are
interconnected), but even in a simple FFNN you can change the number
of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the type of activation
function to use in each layer, the weight initialization logic, the
stochastic gradient optmized and much more. How do you know what
combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?

* You can use grid search with cross-validation to find the right hyperparameters.

However,since there are many hyperparameters to tune, and since
training a neural network on a large dataset takes a lot of time, you
will only be able to explore a tiny part of the hyperparameter space.


* You can use randomized search.
* Or use tools like "Oscar":"http://oscar.calldesk.ai/", which implements more complex algorithms to help you find a good set of hyperparameters quickly.  

!split
===== Hidden layers =====



For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and
it will work just fine.  For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a
high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons.
You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden
layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the same
amount of training time.

For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp up the number of
hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very
complex tasks, such as large image classification or speech
recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers and they
need a huge amount of training data. However, you will rarely have to
train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse
parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar
task.




!split 
===== Which activation function should I use? =====

The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from
the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on
the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost
function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these
gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.


Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as
the algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result,
the GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights virtually
unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is
known in the literature as _the vanishing gradients problem_.

In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can
grow bigger and bigger. The result is that many of the layers get
large updates of the weights the algorithm diverges. This is the
_exploding gradients problem_, which is mostly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep neural networks suffer
from unstable gradients, different layers may learn at widely
different speeds



!split 
===== Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice? =====

Although this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for
quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were
mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that
significant progress was made in understanding it.

A paper titled "Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep
Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html" found that
the problems with the popular logistic
sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique
that was most popular at the time, namely random initialization using
a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. 

They showed that with this activation function and this
initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is
much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the
network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the
activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made
worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0
(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly
better than the logistic function in deep networks).


!split
===== The derivative of the Logistic funtion =====

Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large
(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a
derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,
it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,
and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as
backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is
really nothing left for the lower layers.

In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly
alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both
directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in
the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want
the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For
the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the
variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of
its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance
before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.


!split
===== Insights from the paper by Glorot and Bengio =====

One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that
the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor
choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that
if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in
biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out
that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural
networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because
it does not saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite
fast to compute).



!split
===== The RELU function family =====

The ReLU activation function suffers from a problem known as the dying
ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning they
stop outputting anything other than 0.

In some cases, you may find that half of your network’s neurons are
dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During training,
if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the
neuron’s inputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this
happen, the neuron is unlikely to come back to life since the gradient
of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.

To solve this problem, nowadays practitioners use a variant of the
ReLU function, such as the leaky ReLU discussed above or the so-called
exponential linear unit (ELU) function


!bt
\[
ELU(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \alpha\left( \exp{(z)}-1\right) & z < 0,\\  z & z \ge 0.\end{array}\right. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Which activation function should we use? =====

In general it seems that the ELU activation function is better than
the leaky ReLU function (and its variants), which is better than
ReLU. ReLU performs better than $\tanh$ which in turn performs better
than the logistic function.

If runtime performance is an issue, then you may opt for the leaky
ReLU function over the ELU function If you don’t want to tweak yet
another hyperparameter, you may just use the default $\alpha$ of
$0.01$ for the leaky ReLU, and $1$ for ELU. If you have spare time and
computing power, you can use cross-validation or bootstrap to evaluate
other activation functions.


!split
=====  More on activation functions, output layers =====

In most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden
layers (or one of its variants).

It is a bit faster to compute than other activation functions, and the
gradient descent optimization does in general not get stuck.

_For the output layer:_

* For classification the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive).
* For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all.




!split
===== Batch Normalization =====

Batch Normalization aims to address the vanishing/exploding gradients
problems, and more generally the problem that the distribution of each
layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the
previous layers change.

The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before
the activation function of each layer, simply zero-centering and
normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two
new parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In
other words, this operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and
mean of the inputs for each layer.  In order to zero-center and
normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs’ mean
and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard
deviation of the inputs over the current mini-batch, from this the
name batch normalization.

!split
===== Dropout =====

It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron
(including the input neurons but excluding the output neurons) has a
probability $p$ of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be
entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active
during the next step.

The hyperparameter $p$ is called the dropout rate, and it is typically
set to 50%. After training, the neurons are not dropped anymore.  It
is viewed as one of the most popular regularization techniques.

!split
===== Gradient Clipping =====

A popular technique to lessen the exploding gradients problem is to
simply clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never
exceed some threshold (this is mostly useful for recurrent neural
networks).

This technique is called Gradient Clipping.

In general however, Batch
Normalization is preferred.

===== A top-down perspective on Neural networks =====


The first thing we would like to do is divide the data into two or
three parts. A training set, a validation or dev (development) set,
and a test set. The test set is the data on which we want to make
predictions. The dev set is a subset of the training data we use to
check how well we are doing out-of-sample, after training the model on
the training dataset. We use the validation error as a proxy for the
test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we
do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a
cardinal sin in ML. Then:

 
* Estimate optimal error rate

* Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.

* Make sure you are not overfitting.



!split
===== More top-down perspectives =====

If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions,
then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly
good performance on the test set. 

However, sometimes
the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for
example, they are collected using slightly different methods, or
because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In
this case, there can be a mismatch between the training and test
data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small
differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance
on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation
set. To rectify this, Andrew Ng suggests making two validation or dev
sets, one constructed from the training data and one constructed from
the test data. The difference between the performance of the algorithm
on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This
can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for
supervised learning.

!split
===== Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks =====

Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural
networks has important limitations. This is especially important when
one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like
all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or
better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few
hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random
features). 


!split
===== Limitations of NNs =====

Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. 



* _Need labeled data_. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).
* _Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive._ DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.


!split
===== Homogeneous data =====

* _Homogeneous data._ Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e.~some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.

!split
===== More limitations =====


* _Many problems are not about prediction._ In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.

Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.

!split
===== Codes =====

We present here three different possibilities. The first one is based
on own codes, the second alternative uses TensorFlow with Keras, while
the last version is a simple PyTorch implementation.





!split
===== Building a neural network code =====

Here we  present a flexible object oriented codebase
for a feed forward neural network, along with a demonstration of how
to use it. Before we get into the details of the neural network, we
will first present some implementations of various schedulers, cost
functions and activation functions that can be used together with the
neural network.

The codes here were developed by Eric Reber and Gregor Kajda during spring 2023.

=== Learning rate methods  ===

The code below shows object oriented implementations of the Constant,
Momentum, Adagrad, AdagradMomentum, RMS prop and Adam schedulers. All
of the classes belong to the shared abstract Scheduler class, and
share the update-change() and reset() methods allowing for any of the
schedulers to be seamlessly used during the training stage, as will
later be shown in the fit() method of the neural
network. Update-change() only has one parameter, the gradient
($δ^l_ja^{l−1}_k$), and returns the change which will be subtracted
from the weights. The reset() function takes no parameters, and resets
the desired variables. For Constant and Momentum, reset does nothing.

=== Usage of the above learning rate schedulers ===

To initalize a scheduler, simply create the object and pass in the
necessary parameters such as the learning rate and the momentum as
shown below. As the Scheduler class is an abstract class it should not
called directly, and will raise an error upon usage.

!bc pycod
momentum_scheduler = Momentum(eta=1e-3, momentum=0.9)
adam_scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
!ec

Here is a small example for how a segment of code using schedulers
could look. Switching out the schedulers is simple.

!bc pycod
weights = np.ones((3,3))
print(f"Before scheduler:\n{weights=}")

epochs = 10
for e in range(epochs):
    gradient = np.random.rand(3, 3)
    change = adam_scheduler.update_change(gradient)
    weights = weights - change
    adam_scheduler.reset()

print(f"\nAfter scheduler:\n{weights=}")
!ec


=== Cost functions ===

Here we discuss cost functions that can be used when creating the
neural network. Every cost function takes the target vector as its
parameter, and returns a function valued only at $x$ such that it may
easily be differentiated.


!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np

def CostOLS(target):
    
    def func(X):
        return (1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum((target - X) ** 2)

    return func


def CostLogReg(target):

    def func(X):
        
        return -(1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum(
            (target * np.log(X + 10e-10)) + ((1 - target) * np.log(1 - X + 10e-10))
        )

    return func


def CostCrossEntropy(target):
    
    def func(X):
        return -(1.0 / target.size) * np.sum(target * np.log(X + 10e-10))

    return func
!ec


Below we give a short example of how these cost function may be used
to obtain results if you wish to test them out on your own using
AutoGrad's automatics differentiation.

!bc pycod
from autograd import grad

target = np.array([[1, 2, 3]]).T
a = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T

cost_func = CostCrossEntropy
cost_func_derivative = grad(cost_func(target))

valued_at_a = cost_func_derivative(a)
print(f"Derivative of cost function {cost_func.__name__} valued at a:\n{valued_at_a}")
!ec


=== Activation functions ===

Finally, before we look at the neural network, we will look at the
activation functions which can be specified between the hidden layers
and as the output function. Each function can be valued for any given
vector or matrix X, and can be differentiated via derivate().

!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import elementwise_grad

def identity(X):
    return X


def sigmoid(X):
    try:
        return 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
    except FloatingPointError:
        return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), np.ones(X.shape), np.zeros(X.shape))


def softmax(X):
    X = X - np.max(X, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    delta = 10e-10
    return np.exp(X) / (np.sum(np.exp(X), axis=-1, keepdims=True) + delta)


def RELU(X):
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, np.zeros(X.shape))


def LRELU(X):
    delta = 10e-4
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, delta * X)


def derivate(func):
    if func.__name__ == "RELU":

        def func(X):
            return np.where(X > 0, 1, 0)

        return func

    elif func.__name__ == "LRELU":

        def func(X):
            delta = 10e-4
            return np.where(X > 0, 1, delta)

        return func

    else:
        return elementwise_grad(func)
!ec

Below follows a short demonstration of how to use an activation
function. The derivative of the activation function will be important
when calculating the output delta term during backpropagation. Note
that derivate() can also be used for cost functions for a more
generalized approach.

!bc pycod
z = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T
print(f"Input to activation function:\n{z}")

act_func = sigmoid
a = act_func(z)
print(f"\nOutput from {act_func.__name__} activation function:\n{a}")

act_func_derivative = derivate(act_func)
valued_at_z = act_func_derivative(a)
print(f"\nDerivative of {act_func.__name__} activation function valued at z:\n{valued_at_z}")
!ec

=== The Neural Network ===

Now that we have gotten a good understanding of the implementation of
some important components, we can take a look at an object oriented
implementation of a feed forward neural network. The feed forward
neural network has been implemented as a class named FFNN, which can
be initiated as a regressor or classifier dependant on the choice of
cost function. The FFNN can have any number of input nodes, hidden
layers with any amount of hidden nodes, and any amount of output nodes
meaning it can perform multiclass classification as well as binary
classification and regression problems. Although there is a lot of
code present, it makes for an easy to use and generalizeable interface
for creating many types of neural networks as will be demonstrated
below.

Before we make a model, we will quickly generate a dataset we can use
for our linear regression problem as shown below

!bc pycod
import autograd.numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def SkrankeFunction(x, y):
    return np.ravel(0 + 1*x + 2*y + 3*x**2 + 4*x*y + 5*y**2)

def create_X(x, y, n):
    if len(x.shape) > 1:
        x = np.ravel(x)
        y = np.ravel(y)

    N = len(x)
    l = int((n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2)  # Number of elements in beta
    X = np.ones((N, l))

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        q = int((i) * (i + 1) / 2)
        for k in range(i + 1):
            X[:, q + k] = (x ** (i - k)) * (y**k)

    return X

step=0.5
x = np.arange(0, 1, step)
y = np.arange(0, 1, step)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
target = SkrankeFunction(x, y)
target = target.reshape(target.shape[0], 1)

poly_degree=3
X = create_X(x, y, poly_degree)

X_train, X_test, t_train, t_test = train_test_split(X, target)

!ec

Now that we have our dataset ready for the regression, we can create
our regressor. Note that with the seed parameter, we can make sure our
results stay the same every time we run the neural network. For
inititialization, we simply specify the dimensions (we wish the amount
of input nodes to be equal to the datapoints, and the output to
predict one value).


!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

linear_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=identity, cost_func=CostOLS, seed=2023)

!ec

We then fit our model with our training data using the scheduler of our choice.

!bc pycod
linear_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Constant(eta=1e-3)
scores = linear_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler)


!ec

Due to the progress bar we can see the MSE (train_error) throughout
the FFNN's training. Note that the fit() function has some optional
parameters with defualt arguments. For example, the regularization
hyperparameter can be left ignored if not needed, and equally the FFNN
will by default run for 100 epochs. These can easily be changed, such
as for example:

!bc pycod
linear_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scores = linear_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, lam=1e-4, epochs=1000)

!ec

We see that given more epochs to train on, the regressor reaches a lower MSE.

Let us then switch to a binary classification. We use a binary
classification dataset, and follow a similar setup to the regression
case.



!bc pycod
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

wisconsin = load_breast_cancer()

target = target.reshape(target.shape[0], 1)

X_train, X_val, t_train, t_val = train_test_split(X, target)

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)


!ec

!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

logistic_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)

!ec

We will now make use of our validation data by passing it into our fit function as a keyword argument

!bc pycod
logistic_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = logistic_regression.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, epochs=1000, X_val=X_val, t_val=t_val)


!ec

Finally, we will create a neural network with 2 hidden layers with activation functions.
!bc pycod
input_nodes = X_train.shape[1]
hidden_nodes1 = 100
hidden_nodes2 = 30
output_nodes = 1

dims = (input_nodes, hidden_nodes1, hidden_nodes2, output_nodes)

neural_network = FFNN(dims, hidden_func=RELU, output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)


!ec

!bc pycod
neural_network.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-4, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = neural_network.fit(X_train, t_train, scheduler, epochs=1000, X_val=X_val, t_val=t_val)

=== Multiclass classification ===

Finally, we will demonstrate the use case of multiclass classification
using our FFNN with the famous MNIST dataset, which contain images of
digits between the range of 0 to 9.


!bc pycod
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

def onehot(target: np.ndarray):
    onehot = np.zeros((target.size, target.max() + 1))
    onehot[np.arange(target.size), target] = 1
    return onehot

digits = load_digits()

X = digits.data
target = digits.target
target = onehot(target)

input_nodes = 64
hidden_nodes1 = 100
hidden_nodes2 = 30
output_nodes = 10

dims = (input_nodes, hidden_nodes1, hidden_nodes2, output_nodes)

multiclass = FFNN(dims, hidden_func=LRELU, output_func=softmax, cost_func=CostCrossEntropy)

multiclass.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights

scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-4, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = multiclass.fit(X, target, scheduler, epochs=1000)

===== Testing the XOR gate and other gates =====

Let us now use our code to test the XOR gate.

!bc pycod
X = np.array([ [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0],[1, 1]],dtype=np.float64)

# The XOR gate
yXOR = np.array( [[ 0], [1] ,[1], [0]])

input_nodes = X.shape[1]
output_nodes = 1

logistic_regression = FFNN((input_nodes, output_nodes), output_func=sigmoid, cost_func=CostLogReg, seed=2023)
logistic_regression.reset_weights() # reset weights such that previous runs or reruns don't affect the weights
scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-1, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
scores = logistic_regression.fit(X, yXOR, scheduler, epochs=1000)

Not bad, but the results depend strongly on the learning reate. Try different learning rates.

# Simple NN code using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset (this time the 28 x 28 set)
# The MNIST dataset is loaded using `torchvision.datasets`. The images are transformed to tensors and normalized.
# A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is defined using `nn.Module`.
# The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss. The training loop iterates over the dataset for a specified number of epochs.
# Note that we don't include additional hyperparameters and the learning rate is set to 0.001.  
# After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to compute accuracy.
# The trained model's weights are saved to a file for later use.
# To do: add loops over hyperparameters and learning rates
