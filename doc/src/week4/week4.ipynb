    "the codebase and fit a CNN that yields a 99% accuracy on the 28x28\n",

    " The CNN code consists of different types of Layer classes, including\n",
    "Convolution2DLayer, Pooling2DLayer, FlattenLayer, FullyConnectedLayer\n",
    "and OutputLayer, which can be added to the CNN object using the\n",
    "interface of the CNN class. This allows you to easily construct your\n",
    "own CNN, as well as allowing you to get used to an interface similar\n",
    "to that of TensorFlow which is used for real world applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature of this code is that it throws errors if\n",
    "unreasonable decisions are made (for example using a kernel that is\n",
    "larger than the image, not using a FlattenLayer, etc), and provides\n",
