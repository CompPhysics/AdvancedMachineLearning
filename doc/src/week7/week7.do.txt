===== Building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras =====

  
As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  
  
As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the _convolutional_ and _pooling_ layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). 


!split
===== Setting it up =====

It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or _tensor_. This tensor has the dimensions:  
!bt
\[  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
\]
!et
  
!split
=====  The MNIST dataset again =====

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
$28\times 28$, meaning we require $28 \times 28 = 724$ weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.

If we were to analyze images of size $128\times 128$ we would require
$128 \times 128 = 16384$ weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size $128\times 128$ for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights $= 49152$ are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.
  

!split
===== Strong correlations =====

Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.

Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a "receptive":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field".
  

!split 
===== Layers of a CNN =====
The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. 

A _convolution_ is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as _filters_.


Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the _Rectified Linear (ReLu)_ function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a _pooling layer_, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.


!split
===== Systematic reduction =====  

By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

===== Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

=== Memoryless models ===

Autoregressive models Predict the next term in a sequence from a fixed number of previous terms using _delay taps_.

!bblock Feed-forward neural networks
These generalize autoregressive
models by using one or more
layers of non-linear hidden units. 
!eblock

If we give our generative model some hidden state, and if we give
this hidden state its own internal dynamics, we get a much more
interesting kind of model.
o It can store information in its hidden state for a long time.
o If the dynamics is noisy and the way it generates outputs from its hidden state is noisy, we can never know its exact hidden state.
o The best we can do is to infer a probability distribution over the
space of hidden state vectors.


This inference is only tractable for two types of hidden state model.


=== Linear dynamical model ===

If we give our generative model some hidden state, and if we give
this hidden state its own internal dynamics, we get a much more
interesting kind of model.
o It can store information in its hidden state for a long time.
o  If the dynamics is noisy and the way it generates outputs from its hidden state is noisy, we can never know its exact hidden state.
o The best we can do is to infer a probability distribution over the space of hidden state vectors.


=== Hidden Markov Models ===
Hidden Markov Models have a discrete oneof-$N$ hidden state. Transitions between states
are stochastic and controlled by a transition
matrix. The outputs produced by a state are
stochastic.
* We cannot be sure which state produced a given output. So the state is “hidden”.
* It is easy to represent a probability distribution across N states with N numbers.
* To predict the next output we need to infer the probability distribution over hidden states.

HMMs have efficient algorithms for inference and learning

=== RNNs ===

RNNs are very powerful, because they
combine two properties:
o Distributed hidden state that allows them to store a lot of information about the past efficiently.
o Non-linear dynamics that allows them to update their hidden state in complicated ways.

With enough neurons and time, RNNs
can compute anything that can be
computed by your computer.


=== Do generative models need to be stochastic? ===

!bblock Linear dynamical systems and hidden Markov models are stochastic models.

But the posterior probability
distribution over their
hidden states given the
observed data so far is a
deterministic function of the
data.
!eblock 


!bblock Recurrent neural networks are deterministic.
Think of the hidden state
of an RNN as the
equivalent of the
deterministic probability
distribution over hidden
states in a linear dynamical
system or hidden Markov
model.
!eblock

=== What kinds of behaviour can RNNs exhibit? ===
o They can oscillate. 
o They can settle to point attractors.
o They can behave chaotically.
o RNNs could potentially learn to implement lots of small programs that each capture a nugget of knowledge and run in parallel, interacting to produce very complicated effects.

But the computational power of RNNs makes them very hard to train.

!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/RNN1.png, width=700 frac=0.9]


=== We need to specify the initial activity state of all the hidden and output units ===

o We could just fix these initial states to have some default value like 0.5.
o But it is better to treat the initial states as learned parameters.
o We learn them in the same way as we learn the weights.

* Start off with an initial random guess for the initial states.
  o At the end of each training sequence, backpropagate through time all the way to the initial states to get the gradient of the error function with respect to each initial state.
  o Adjust the initial states by following the negative gradient. 



=== We can specify inputs in several ways ===

o Specify the initial states of all the units.
o Specify the initial states of a subset of the units.
o Specify the states of the same subset of the units at every time step.

This is the natural way to model most sequential data. 


=== We can specify targets in several ways ===

o Specify desired final activities of all the units
o Specify desired activities of all units for the last few steps

* Good for learning attractors
* It is easy to add in extra error derivatives as we backpropagate.
  * Specify the desired activity of a subset of the units.
* The other units are input or hidden units.

=== Backpropagation through time ===

!bblock
We can think of the recurrent net as a layered, feed-forward
net with shared weights and then train the feed-forward net
with weight constraints.
!eblock

We can also think of this training algorithm in the time domain:
o The forward pass builds up a stack of the activities of all the units at each time step.
o The backward pass peels activities off the stack to compute the error derivatives at each time step.
o After the backward pass we add together the derivatives at all the different times for each weight. 


=== The backward pass is linear ===

o There is a big difference between the forward and backward passes.
o In the forward pass we use squashing functions (like the logistic) to prevent the activity vectors from exploding.
o The backward pass, is completely linear. If you double the error derivatives at the final layer, all the error derivatives will double.

The forward pass determines the slope of the linear function used for
backpropagating through each neuron

!split 
===== The problem of exploding or vanishing gradients =====
* What happens to the magnitude of the gradients as we backpropagate through many layers?
  o If the weights are small, the gradients shrink exponentially.
  o If the weights are big the gradients grow exponentially.
* Typical feed-forward neural nets can cope with these exponential effects because they only have a few hidden layers.
* In an RNN trained on long sequences (e.g. 100 time steps) the gradients can easily explode or vanish.
  o We can avoid this by initializing the weights very carefully.
* Even with good initial weights, its very hard to detect that the current target output depends on an input from many time-steps ago.


RNNs have difficulty dealing with long-range dependencies. 


!split
===== Four effective ways to learn an RNN =====
o Long Short Term Memory Make the RNN out of little modules that are designed to remember values for a long time.
o Hessian Free Optimization: Deal with the vanishing gradients problem by using a fancy optimizer that can detect directions with a tiny gradient but even smaller curvature.
o Echo State Networks: Initialize the input a hidden and hidden-hidden and output-hidden connections very carefully so that the hidden state has a huge reservoir of weakly coupled oscillators which can be selectively driven by the input.
  * ESNs only need to learn the hidden-output connections.
o Good initialization with momentum Initialize like in Echo State Networks, but then learn all of the connections using momentum


=== Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) ===

LSTM uses a memory cell for   modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 


=== Implementing a memory cell in a neural network ===
To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives.

===== Formatting the Data =====

The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.


# 
# The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html).
# 
# The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow.
# 
# Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.

===== Other Things to Try =====


Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

===== Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".

The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also
URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02857.pdf".
