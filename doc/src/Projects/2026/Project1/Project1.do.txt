======= Possible paths for project 1  =======

We discuss here several paths as well as data sets for the first project (or as parts of a larger project).

===== Paths for the projects =====

* The computational path: Here we propose a path where you develop your own code for a convolutional or eventually recurrent neural network and apply this to data selects of your own selection. The code should be object oriented and flexible allowing for eventual extensions by including different Loss/Cost functions and other functionalities. Feel free toselect data sets from those suggested below here. This code can also be extended upon by adding for example autoencoders. You can compare your own codes with implementations using TensorFlow(Keras)/PyTorch or other libraries. An alternative is to develop a code for an RNN inclusing long-term-short-memory (LSTM). This is often the starting point for large-language models and so-called transformers. Large language models are hovever not discussed during the lectures.

* The differential equation path: Here we propose a set of differential equations (ordinary and/or partial) to be solved first using neural networks (using either your own code or TensorFlow/Pytorch or similar libraries). Thereafter we plan to extend the set of methods for solving these equations to recurrent neural networks and autoencoders (AE). This project can also be extended into including Physics informed machine learning, see URL:"https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs". Here we can discuss neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given law of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. 

* The application path: Here you can use the most relevant method(s) (say convolutional neural networks for images) and apply this(these) to data sets relevant for your own research.

* The Gaussian processes/Bayesian statistics path: Kernel regression (Gaussian processes) and Bayesian statistics, see URL:"https://jenfb.github.io/bkmr/overview.html", are  popular tools in the machine learning literature. The main idea behind these approaches is to flexibly model the relationship between a large number of variables and a particular outcome (dependent variable). This can form a second part of a project where for example standard Kernel regression methods are used on a specific data set. Alternatively, participants can opt to work on a large project relevant for their own research using gaussian processes and/or Bayesian machine Learning. 

* Other possibilities.

===== Defining the data sets to analyze yourself =====

You can propose own data sets that relate to your research interests or just use existing data sets from say
* "Kaggle":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" 
* The "University of California at Irvine (UCI) with its  machine learning repository":"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php".
* For the differential equation problems, you can generate your own datasets, as described below.

* If possible, you should link the data sets with existing research and analyses thereof. Scientific articles which have used Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the data are highly welcome. Perhaps you can improve previous analyses and even publish a new article? 

* A critical assessment of the methods with ditto perspectives and recommendations is also something you need to include. For those of you familiar with report writing, the layouts discussed in for example "FYS-STK4155":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/blob/master/doc/Projects/EvaluationGrading/EvaluationForm.md".





===== Introduction to numerical projects =====

Here follows a brief recipe and recommendation on how to write a report for each
project.

  * Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.

  * Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.

  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.

  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.

  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.

  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.

  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.

  * Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.

  * Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.






===== Format for electronic delivery of report and programs =====

The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:

  * Send us an email in order  to hand in your projects with a link to your GitHub/Gitlab repository.

  * In your GitHub/GitLab or similar repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.


Finally, 
we encourage you to collaborate. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report.
