As previously said, the restricted solver has been employed only for a comparison with the corresponding results for the ground state coming associated to the general representation. The restricted solver has not been used in the time-dependent context, thus further integrations and testings of the code can be performed. 

All the results presented above for the time-dependent system would require a more detailed analysis and further tests: a longer time for the simulations is recommended, and more combinations of $\Omega$ and $\omega$ can be implemented, varying also the time spent with the laser source in operation.

Finally, the mentioned analysis can be applied also to the time-evolved version of the ground state provided by the general solver for lower values of tolerance. All the procedures could be testing also varying the number of eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator that we employ for the expansion of the single particle states.
