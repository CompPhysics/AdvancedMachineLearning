===== RBM using TensorFlow and Keras =====

===== Codes for Energy-based models =====

See discussions in Foster, chapter 7 on energy-based models at URL:"https://github.com/davidADSP/Generative_Deep_Learning_2nd_Edition/tree/main/notebooks/07_ebm/01_ebm"

That notebook is based on a recent article by Du and Mordatch, _Implicit generation and modeling with energy-based models_, see URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08689.pdf."

!split
===== Langevin sampling =====

Also called Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), is sampling
technique composed of characteristics from Stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) and Langevin dynamics, a mathematical extension of the Langevin
equation.  The SGLD is an iterative
optimization algorithm which uses minibatching to create a stochastic
gradient estimator, as used in SGD to optimize a differentiable
objective function.

Unlike traditional SGD, SGLD can be used for
Bayesian learning as a sampling method. SGLD may be viewed as Langevin
dynamics applied to posterior distributions, but the key difference is
that the likelihood gradient terms are minibatched, like in SGD. SGLD,
like Langevin dynamics, produces samples from a posterior distribution
of parameters based on available data.

!split
===== More on the SGLD =====

The SGLD uses the probability $p(\theta)$ (note that we limit
ourselves to just a variable $\theta$) and updates the _log_ of this
probability by initializing it through some random prior distribution,
normally just a uniform distribution which takes values between
$\theta\in [-1,1]$,

The update is given by
!bt
\[
\theta_{i+1}=\theta_{i}+\eta \nabla_{\theta} \log{p(\theta_{i})}+\sqrt{\eta}w_i,
\]
!et
where $w_i\sim N(0,1)$ are normally distributed with mean zero and
variance one and $i=0,1,\dots,k$, with $k$ the final number of
iterations.  The parameter $\eta$ is the learning rate. The term
$\sqrt{\eta}w_i$ introduces _noise_ in the equation.

!split
===== Code example of Langevin Samplig =====

In our calculations the gradient is calculated using the model we have
for the probability distribution. For an energy-based model this gives
us a derivative which involves the so-called positive and negative
phases discussed last week.

Read more about Langevin sampling at for example
URL:"https://www.lyndonduong.com/sgmcmc/". This site contains a nice
example of a PyTorch code which implements Langevin sampling.

!split
===== Theory of Variational Autoencoders =====

Let us remind ourself about what an autoencoder is, see the jupyter-notebook at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/AdvancedMachineLearning/blob/main/doc/pub/week10/ipynb/week10.ipynb".


!split
===== The Autoencoder again =====


Autoencoders are neural networks where the outputs are its own
inputs. They are split into an _encoder part_
which maps the input $\bm{x}$ via a function $f(\bm{x},\bm{W})$ (this
is the encoder part) to a _so-called code part_ (or intermediate part)
with the result $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W})),
\]
!et
where $\bm{W}$ are the weights to be determined.  The _decoder_ parts maps, via its own parameters (weights given by the matrix $\bm{V}$ and its own biases) to 
the final ouput
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V})).
\]
!et

The goal is to minimize the construction error, often done by optimizing the means squared error.

!split

!split
===== Mathematics of Variational Autoencoders =====

We have defined earlier a probability (marginal) distribution with hidden variables $\bm{h}$ and parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \int d\bm{h}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for continuous variables $\bm{h}$ and
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{h}}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for discrete stochastic events $\bm{h}$. The variables $\bm{h}$ are normally called the _latent variables_ in the theory of autoencoders. We will also call then for that here.

!split
===== Using the conditional probability =====

Using the the definition of the conditional probabilities $p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$, $p(\bm{h}\vert\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ and 
and the prior $p(\bm{h})$, we can rewrite the above equation as
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \sum_{\bm{h}}p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})p(\bm{h},
\]
!et

which allows us to make the dependence of $\bm{x}$ on $\bm{h}$
explicit by using the law of total probability. The intuition behind
this approach for finding the marginal probability for $\bm{x}$ is to
optimize the above equations with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\Theta}$.  This is done normally by maximizing the probability,
the so-called maximum-likelihood approach discussed earlier.

!split
===== VAEs versus autoencoders =====

This trained probability is assumed to be able to produce similar
samples as the input.  In VAEs it is then common to compare via for
example the mean-squared error or the cross-entropy the predicted
values with the input values.  Compared with autoencoders, we are now
producing a probability instead of a functions which mimicks the
input.

In VAEs, the choice of this output distribution is often Gaussian,
meaning that the conditional probability is
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})=N(\bm{x}\vert f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}), \sigma^2\times \bm{I}),
\]
!et
with mean value given by the function $f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ and a
diagonal covariance matrix multiplied by a parameter $\sigma^2$ which
is treated as a hyperparameter.

!split
===== Gradient descent =====

By having a Gaussian distribution, we can use gradient descent (or any
other optimization technique) to increase $p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ by
making $f(\bm{h};\bm{\Theta})$ approach $\bm{x}$ for some $\bm{h}$,
gradually making the training data more likely under the generative
model. The important property is simply that the marginal probability
can be computed, and it is continuous in $\bm{\Theta}$..

!split
===== Are VAEs just modified autoencoders? =====

The mathematical basis of VAEs actually has relatively little to do
with classical autoencoders, for example the sparse autoencoders or
denoising autoencoders discussed earlier.

VAEs approximately maximize the probability equation discussed
above. They are called autoencoders only because the final training
objective that derives from this setup does have an encoder and a
decoder, and resembles a traditional autoencoder. Unlike sparse
autoencoders, there are generally no tuning parameters analogous to
the sparsity penalties. And unlike sparse and denoising autoencoders,
we can sample directly from $p(\bm{x})$ without performing Markov
Chain Monte Carlo.


!split
===== Training VAEs =====

To solve the integral or sum for $p(\bm{x})$, there are two problems
that VAEs must deal with: how to define the latent variables $\bm{h}$,
that is decide what information they represent, and how to deal with
the integral over $\bm{h}$.  VAEs give a definite answer to both.



!split
===== Kullback-Leibler relative entropy (notation to be updated) =====

When the goal of the training is to approximate a probability
distribution, as it is in generative modeling, another relevant
measure is the _Kullback-Leibler divergence_, also known as the
relative entropy or Shannon entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the
dissimilarity between two probability density functions $p$ and
$q$. If $p$ is the unkown probability which we approximate with $q$,
we can measure the difference by
!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL}(p||q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p (\bm{x}) \log \frac{p(\bm{x})}{q(\bm{x})}  d\bm{x}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Kullback-Leibler divergence and RBMs =====

Thus, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the
training data $f(\bm{x})$ and the model marginal distribution $p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ from an RBM is

!bt
\begin{align*}
	\text{KL} (f(\bm{x})|| p(\bm{x}| \bm{\Theta})) =& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	f (\bm{x}) \log \frac{f(\bm{x})}{p(\bm{x}; \bm{\Theta})} d\bm{x} \\
	=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log f(\bm{x}) d\bm{x} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\bm{x}) \log
	p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) d\bm{x} \\
	%=& \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log f(\bm{x})) - \mathbb{E}_{f(\bm{x})} (\log p(\bm{x}; \bm{\Theta}))
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} - \langle \log p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) \rangle_{f(\bm{x})} \\
	=& \langle \log f(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \langle E(\bm{x}) \rangle_{data} + \log Z.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Maximizing log-likelihood =====

The first term is constant with respect to $\bm{\Theta}$ since
$f(\bm{x})$ is independent of $\bm{\Theta}$. Thus the Kullback-Leibler
divergence is minimal when the second term is minimal. The second term
is the log-likelihood cost function, hence minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the
log-likelihood. 


!split
===== Back to VAEs =====

We want to train the marginal probability with some latent varriables $\bm{h}$
!bt
\[
p(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta}) = \int d\bm{h}p(\bm{x},\bm{h};\bm{\Theta}),
\]
!et
for the continuous version (see previous slides for the discrete variant).


!split
===== Using the KL divergence =====

In practice, for most $\bm{h}$, $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h}; \bm{\Theta})$
will be nearly zero, and hence contribute almost nothing to our
estimate of $p(\bm{x})$.

The key idea behind the variational autoencoder is to attempt to
sample values of $\bm{h}$ that are likely to have produced $\bm{x}$,
and compute $p(\bm{x})$ just from those.

This means that we need a new function $Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$ which can
take a value of $\bm{x}$ and give us a distribution over $\bm{h}$
values that are likely to produce $\bm{x}$.  Hopefully the space of
$\bm{h}$ values that are likely under $Q$ will be much smaller than
the space of all $\bm{h}$'s that are likely under the prior
$p(\bm{h})$.  This lets us, for example, compute $E_{\bm{h}\sim
Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ relatively easily. Note that we drop
$\bm{\Theta}$ from here and for notational simplicity.


!split
===== Kullback-Leibler again =====

However, if $\bm{h}$ is sampled from an arbitrary distribution with
PDF $Q(\bm{h})$, which is not $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, then how does that
help us optimize $p(\bm{x})$?

The first thing we need to do is relate
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}P(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$.  We will see where $Q$ comes from later.

The relationship between $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ and $p(\bm{x})$ is one of the cornerstones of variational Bayesian methods.
We begin with the definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence or $\mathcal{D}$) between $p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})$ and $Q(\bm{h})$, for some arbitrary $Q$ (which may or may not depend on $\bm{x}$):
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}|\bm{x}) \right].
\]
!et

!split
===== And applying Bayes rule =====

We can get both $p(\bm{x})$ and $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{h})$ into this equation by applying Bayes rule to $p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$
!bt
\[
    \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h}) - \log p(\bm{h}) \right] + \log p(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

Here, $\log p(\bm{x})$ comes out of the expectation because it does not depend on $\bm{h}$.
Negating both sides, rearranging, and contracting part of $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}$ into a KL-divergence terms yields:
!bt
\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}\vert \bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}\vert\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|P(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Rearraning =====

Using Bayes rule we obtain
!bt
\[
E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{h}|y_i,x_i) - \log p(\bm{h}|x_i) + \log p(y_i|x_i) \right]
\]
!et

Rearranging the terms and subtracting $E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\log Q(\bm{h})$ from both sides gives
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\log P(y_i|x_i) - E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log Q(\bm{h})-\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)\right]=\hspace{10em}\\
\hspace{10em}E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(y_i|\bm{h},x_i)+\log p(\bm{h}|x_i)-\log Q(\bm{h})\right]
\end{array}
\]
!et
Note that $\bm{x}$ is fixed, and $Q$ can be \textit{any} distribution, not
just a distribution which does a good job mapping $\bm{x}$ to the $\bm{h}$'s
that can produce $X$.


!split
===== Inferring the probability =====

Since we are interested in inferring $p(\bm{x})$, it makes sense to
construct a $Q$ which \textit{does} depend on $\bm{x}$, and in particular,
one which makes $\mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]$ small
!bt
\[
\log p(\bm{x}) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\right]=E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}\left[\log p(\bm{x}|\bm{h})  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h})\right].
\]
!et

Hence, during training, it makes sense to choose a $Q$ which will make
$E_{\bm{h}\sim Q}[\log Q(\bm{h})-$ $\log p(\bm{h}|x_i,y_i)]$ (a
$\mathcal{D}$-divergence) small, such that the right hand side is a
close approximation to $\log p(y_i|y_i)$.

!split
===== Central equation of VAEs =====

This equation serves as the core of the variational autoencoder, and
it is worth spending some time thinking about what it means.

o The left hand side has the quantity we want to maximize, namely $\log p(\bm{x})$ plus an error term.
o The right hand side is something we can optimize via stochastic gradient descent given the right choice of $Q$.


!split
===== Setting up SGD =====
So how can we perform stochastic gradient descent?

First we need to be a bit more specific about the form that $Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})$
will take.  The usual choice is to say that
$Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})=\mathcal{N}(\bm{h}|\mu(\bm{x};\vartheta),\Sigma(;\vartheta))$, where
$\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are arbitrary deterministic functions with
parameters $\vartheta$ that can be learned from data (we will omit
$\vartheta$ in later equations).  In practice, $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are
again implemented via neural networks, and $\Sigma$ is constrained to
be a diagonal matrix.


!split
===== More on the SGD =====

The name variational ``autoencoder'' comes from
the fact that $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are ``encoding'' $\bm{x}$ into the latent
space $\bm{h}$.  The advantages of this choice are computational, as they
make it clear how to compute the right hand side.  The last
term---$\mathcal{D}\left[Q(\bm{h}|\bm{x})\|p(\bm{h})\right]$---is now a KL-divergence
between two multivariate Gaussian distributions, which can be computed
in closed form as:
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
 \mathcal{D}[\mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\Sigma_0) \| \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\Sigma_1)] = \hspace{20em}\\
  \hspace{5em}\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \left( \mathrm{tr} \left( \Sigma_1^{-1} \Sigma_0 \right) + \left( \mu_1 - \mu_0\right)^\top \Sigma_1^{-1} ( \mu_1 - \mu_0 ) - k + \log \left( \frac{ \det \Sigma_1 }{ \det \Sigma_0  } \right)  \right)
\end{array}
\]
!et
where $k$ is the dimensionality of the distribution.

!split
===== Simplification =====
In our case, this simplifies to:
!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
 \mathcal{D}[\mathcal{N}(\mu(X),\Sigma(X)) \| \mathcal{N}(0,I)] = \hspace{20em}\\
\hspace{6em}\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \left( \mathrm{tr} \left( \Sigma(X) \right) + \left( \mu(X)\right)^\top ( \mu(X) ) - k - \log\det\left(  \Sigma(X)  \right)  \right).
\end{array}
\]
!et


!split
===== Terms to compute =====

The first term on the right hand side is a bit more tricky.
We could use sampling to estimate $E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$, but getting a good estimate would require passing many samples of $z$ through $f$, which would be expensive.
Hence, as is standard in stochastic gradient descent, we take one sample of $z$ and treat $\log P(X|z)$ for that $z$ as an approximation of $E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$.
After all, we are already doing stochastic gradient descent over different values of $X$ sampled from a dataset $D$.
The full equation we want to optimize is:

!bt
\[
\begin{array}{c}
    E_{X\sim D}\left[\log P(X) - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z|X)\right]\right]=\hspace{16em}\\
\hspace{10em}E_{X\sim D}\left[E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right] - \mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right]\right].
\end{array}
\]
!et


!split
===== Computing the gradients =====

If we take the gradient of this equation, the gradient symbol can be moved into the expectations.
Therefore, we can sample a single value of $X$ and a single value of $z$ from the distribution $Q(z|X)$, and compute the gradient of:
!bt
\begin{equation}
 \log P(X|z)-\mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right].
\end{equation}
!et

We can then average the gradient of this function over arbitrarily many samples of $X$ and $z$, and the result converges to the gradient.

There is, however, a significant problem
$E_{z\sim Q}\left[\log P(X|z)  \right]$ depends not just on the parameters of $P$, but also on the parameters of $Q$.

In order to make VAEs work, it is essential to drive $Q$ to produce codes for $X$ that $P$ can reliably decode.  
!bt
\[
 E_{X\sim D}\left[E_{\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)}[\log P(X|z=\mu(X)+\Sigma^{1/2}(X)*\epsilon)]-\mathcal{D}\left[Q(z|X)\|P(z)\right]\right].
\]

===== What is a GAN? =====

A GAN is a deep neural network which consists of two networks, a
so-called generator network and a discriminating network, or just
discriminator. Through several iterations of generation and
discrimination, the idea is that these networks will train each other,
while also trying to outsmart each other.

!split
===== What is a generator network? =====

A generator network is often a deep network which uses existing data
to generate new data (from for example simulations of physical
systems, imagesm video, audio and more) from randomly generated
inputs, the so-called latent space. Training the network allows us to
generate say new data, images etc. As an example a generator network
could for example be a Boltzmann machine as discussed earlier. This
machine is trained to produce for example a quantum mechanical
probability distribution.

It can a simple neural network with an input layer and an output layer and a given number of hidden layers.

!split
===== And what is a discriminator network? =====

A discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and those generated by the abovementioned generator.

!split
===== Appplications of GANs =====

There are exteremely many applications of GANs
o Image generation
o Text-to-image analysis
o Face-aging
o Image-to-image translation
o Video synthesis
o High-resolution image generation
o Completing missing parts of images and much more

!split
===== Generative Adversarial Networks =====

_Generative Adversarial Networks_ are a type of unsupervised machine learning
algorithm proposed by Goodfellow et. al, see URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf"
in 2014 (Read the paper first it's only 6 pages). The simplest formulation of
the model is based on a game theoretic approach, *zero sum game*, where we pit
two neural networks against one another. We define two rival networks, one
generator $g$, and one discriminator $d$. The generator directly produces
samples
!bt
\[
    x = g(z; \theta^{(g)}).
\]
!et


!split
===== Discriminator =====

The discriminator attempts to distinguish between samples drawn from the
training data and samples drawn from the generator. In other words, it tries to
tell the difference between the fake data produced by $g$ and the actual data
samples we want to do prediction on. The discriminator outputs a probability
value given by

!bt
\[
    d(x; \theta^{(d)}).
\]
!et

indicating the probability that $x$ is a real training example rather than a
fake sample the generator has generated.


!split
===== Zero-sum game =====

The simplest way to formulate the
learning process in a generative adversarial network is a zero-sum game, in
which a function

!bt
\[
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)}),
\]
!et

determines the reward for the discriminator, while the generator gets the
conjugate reward

!bt
\[
    -v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\]
!et


!split
===== Maximizing reward =====

During learning both of the networks maximize their own reward function, so that
the generator gets better and better at tricking the discriminator, while the
discriminator gets better and better at telling the difference between the fake
and real data. The generator and discriminator alternate on which one trains at
one time (i.e. for one epoch). In other words, we keep the generator constant
and train the discriminator, then we keep the discriminator constant to train
the generator and repeat. It is this back and forth dynamic which lets GANs
tackle otherwise intractable generative problems. As the generator improves with
 training, the discriminator's performance gets worse because it cannot easily
 tell the difference between real and fake. If the generator ends up succeeding
 perfectly, the the discriminator will do no better than random guessing i.e.
 50\%.


!split
===== Progression in training =====

This progression in the training poses a problem for the convergence
 criteria for GANs. The discriminator feedback gets less meaningful over time,
 if we continue training after this point then the generator is effectively
 training on junk data which can undo the learning up to that point. Therefore,
 we stop training when the discriminator starts outputting $1/2$ everywhere.
 At convergence we have

!bt
\[
    g^* = \underset{g}{\mathrm{argmin}}\hspace{2pt}
          \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)}),
\]
!et


!split
===== Deafault choice =====
The default choice for $v$ is
!bt
\[
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)}) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{data}}\log d(x)
                                  + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{model}}
                                  \log (1 - d(x)).
\]
!et


!split
===== Design of GANs =====
The main motivation for the design of GANs is that the learning process requires
neither approximate inference (variational autoencoders for example) nor
approximation of a partition function. In the case where
!bt
\[
    \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\]
!et
is convex in $\theta^{(g)}$ then the procedure is guaranteed to converge and is
asymptotically consistent
( "Seth Lloyd on QuGANs": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09139.pdf"  ). This is in
general not the case and it is possible to get situations where the training
process never converges because the generator and discriminator chase one
another around in the parameter space indefinitely.


!split
===== More references =====

A much deeper discussion on
the currently open research problem of GAN convergence is available
from URL:"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html". To
anyone interested in learning more about GANs it is a highly recommended read.
Direct quote: _In this best-performing formulation, the generator aims to
increase the log probability that the discriminator makes a mistake, rather than
aiming to decrease the log probability that the discriminator makes the correct
prediction._ Another interesting read can be found at URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160".

!split
===== Writing Our First Generative Adversarial Network =====

This part is best seen using the jupyter-notebook.

Let us implement a GAN in tensorflow. We will study
the performance of our GAN on the MNIST dataset. This code is based on and
adapted from the Google tutorial at URL:"https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan"

First we import our libraries

!bc pycod
import os
import time
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
!ec

Next we define our hyperparameters and import our data the usual way

!bc pycod
BUFFER_SIZE = 60000
BATCH_SIZE = 256
EPOCHS = 30

data = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = data
train_images = np.reshape(train_images, (train_images.shape[0],
                                         28,
                                         28,
                                         1)).astype('float32')

# we normalize between -1 and 1
train_images = (train_images - 127.5) / 127.5
training_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
                      train_images).shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
!ec

Let's have a quick look

!bc pycod
plt.imshow(train_images[0], cmap='Greys')
plt.show()
!ec

Now we define our two models. This is where the 'magic' happens. There are a
huge amount of possible formulations for both models. A lot of engineering and
trial and error can be done here to try to produce better performing models. For
more advanced GANs this is by far the step where you can 'make or break' a
model.

We start with the generator. As stated in the introductory text the generator
$g$ upsamples from a random sample to the shape of what we want to predict. In
our case we are trying to predict MNIST images ($28\times 28$ pixels).

!bc pycod
def generator_model():
    """
    The generator uses upsampling layers tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose() to
    produce an image from a random seed. We start with a Dense layer taking this
    random sample as an input and subsequently upsample through multiple
    convolutional layers.
    """

    # we define our model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()


    # adding our input layer. Dense means that every neuron is connected and
    # the input shape is the shape of our random noise. The units need to match
    # in some sense the upsampling strides to reach our desired output shape.

    model.add(layers.Dense(units=7*7*BATCH_SIZE,
                           use_bias=False,
                           input_shape=(100, )))
    # we normalize the output form the Dense layer
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    # and add an activation function to our 'layer'. LeakyReLU avoids vanishing
    # gradient problem
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Reshape((7, 7, BATCH_SIZE)))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 7, 7, BATCH_SIZE)
    # even though we just added four keras layers we think of everything above
    # as 'one' layer

    # next we add our upscaling convolutional layers
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=128,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(1, 1),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 7, 7, 128)

    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=64,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(2, 2),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 14, 14, 64)

    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=1,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(2, 2),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False,
                                     activation='tanh'))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 28, 28, 1)

    return model

!ec

And there we have our 'simple' generator model. Now we move on to defining our
discriminator model $d$, which is a convolutional neural network based image
classifier.

!bc pycod
def discriminator_model():
    """
    The discriminator is a convolutional neural network based image classifier
    """

    # we define our model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters=64,
                            kernel_size=(5, 5),
                            strides=(2, 2),
                            padding='same',
                            input_shape=[28, 28, 1]))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))


    model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters=128,
                            kernel_size=(5, 5),
                            strides=(2, 2),
                            padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))

    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(1))

    return model
!ec

Let us take a look at our models. _Note_: double click images for bigger view.

!bc pycod
generator = generator_model()
plot_model(generator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

!bc pycod
discriminator = discriminator_model()
plot_model(discriminator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

Next we need a few helper objects we will use in training

!bc pycod
cross_entropy = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
generator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
discriminator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
!ec

The first object, $cross\_entropy$ is our loss function and the two others are
our optimizers. Notice we use the same learning rate for both $g$ and $d$. This
is because they need to improve their accuracy at approximately equal speeds to
get convergence (not necessarily exactly equal). Now we define our loss
functions

!bc pycod
def generator_loss(fake_output):
    loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(fake_output), fake_output)

    return loss
!ec

!bc pycod
def discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output):
    real_loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output)
    fake_loss = cross_entropy(tf.zeros_liks(fake_output), fake_output)
    total_loss = real_loss + fake_loss

    return total_loss
!ec

Next we define a kind of seed to help us compare the learning process over
multiple training epochs.

!bc pycod
noise_dimension = 100
n_examples_to_generate = 16
seed_images = tf.random.normal([n_examples_to_generate, noise_dimension])
!ec

Now we have everything we need to define our training step, which we will apply
for every step in our training loop. Notice the @tf.function flag signifying
that the function is tensorflow 'compiled'. Removing this flag doubles the
computation time.

!bc pycod
@tf.function
def train_step(images):
    noise = tf.random.normal([BATCH_SIZE, noise_dimension])

    with tf.GradientTape() as gen_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
        generated_images = generator(noise, training=True)

        real_output = discriminator(images, training=True)
        fake_output = discriminator(generated_images, training=True)

        gen_loss = generator_loss(fake_output)
        disc_loss = discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output)

    gradients_of_generator = gen_tape.gradient(gen_loss,
                                            generator.trainable_variables)
    gradients_of_discriminator = disc_tape.gradient(disc_loss,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables)
    generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_generator,
                                            generator.trainable_variables))
    discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_discriminator,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables))

    return gen_loss, disc_loss
!ec


Next we define a helper function to produce an output over our training epochs
to see the predictive progression of our generator model. _Note_: I am including
this code here, but comment it out in the training loop.
!bc pycod
def generate_and_save_images(model, epoch, test_input):
    # we're making inferences here
    predictions = model(test_input, training=False)

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))

    for i in range(predictions.shape[0]):
        plt.subplot(4, 4, i+1)
        plt.imshow(predictions[i, :, :, 0] * 127.5 + 127.5, cmap='gray')
        plt.axis('off')

    plt.savefig(f'./images_from_seed_images/image_at_epoch_{str(epoch).zfill(3)}.png')
    plt.close()
    #plt.show()
!ec

Setting up checkpoints to periodically save our model during training so that
everything is not lost even if the program were to somehow terminate while
training.

!bc pycod
# Setting up checkpoints to save model during training
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'ckpt')
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(generator_optimizer=generator_optimizer,
                            discriminator_optimizer=discriminator_optimizer,
                            generator=generator,
                            discriminator=discriminator)
!ec

Now we define our training loop

!bc pycod
def train(dataset, epochs):
    generator_loss_list = []
    discriminator_loss_list = []

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        start = time.time()

        for image_batch in dataset:
            gen_loss, disc_loss = train_step(image_batch)
            generator_loss_list.append(gen_loss.numpy())
            discriminator_loss_list.append(disc_loss.numpy())

        #generate_and_save_images(generator, epoch + 1, seed_images)

        if (epoch + 1) % 15 == 0:
            checkpoint.save(file_prefix=checkpoint_prefix)

        print(f'Time for epoch {epoch} is {time.time() - start}')

    #generate_and_save_images(generator, epochs, seed_images)

    loss_file = './data/lossfile.txt'
    with open(loss_file, 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(generator_loss_list))
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write(str(discriminator_loss_list))
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write('\n')
!ec


To train simply call this function. _Warning_: this might take a long time so
there is a folder of a pretrained network already included in the repository.

!bc pycod
train(train_dataset, EPOCHS)
!ec

And here is the result of training our model for 100 epochs

MOVIE: [images_from_seed_images/generation.gif]

Now to avoid having to train and everything, which will take a while depending
on your computer setup we now load in the model which produced the above gif.

!bc pycod
checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))
restored_generator = checkpoint.generator
restored_discriminator = checkpoint.discriminator

print(restored_generator)
print(restored_discriminator)
!ec


===== Exploring the Latent Space =====

So we have successfully loaded in our latest model. Let us now play around a bit
and see what kind of things we can learn about this model. Our generator takes
an array of 100 numbers. One idea can be to try to systematically change our
input. Let us try and see what we get

!bc pycod
def generate_latent_points(number=100, scale_means=1, scale_stds=1):
    latent_dim = 100
    means = scale_means * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    stds = scale_stds * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    latent_space_value_range = tf.random.normal([number, number],
                                                means,
                                                stds,
                                                dtype=tf.float64)

    return latent_space_value_range

def generate_images(latent_points):
    # notice we set training to false because we are making inferences
    generated_images = restored_generator(latent_space_value_range,
                                          training=False)

    return generated_images
!ec

!bc pycod
def plot_result(generated_images, number):
    # obviously this assumes sqrt number is an int
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(int(np.sqrt(number)), int(np.sqrt(number)),
                            figsize=(10, 10))

    for i in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
        for j in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
            axs[i, j].imshow(generated_images[i*j], cmap='Greys')
            axs[i, j].axis('off')

    plt.show()
!ec

!bc pycod
generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points())
plot_result(generated_images, number)
!ec

Interesting! We see that the generator generates images that look like MNIST
numbers: $1, 4, 7, 9$. Let's try to tweak it a bit more to see if we are able
to generate a similar plot where we generate every MNIST number. Let us now try
to 'move' a bit around in the latent space. _Note_: decrease the plot number if
these following cells take too long to run on your computer.

Again, we have found something interesting. *Moving* around using our means
takes us from digit to digit, while *moving* around using our standard
deviations seem to increase the number of different digits! In the last image
above, we can barely make out every MNIST digit. Let us make on last plot using
this information by upping the standard deviation of our Gaussian noises.

                                                          scale_stds=10))

A pretty cool result! We see that our generator indeed has learned a
distribution which qualitatively looks a whole lot like the MNIST dataset.
